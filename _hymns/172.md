The Gospel is of God<br>To magnify His Son,<br>For Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>By power God's will hath done:<br>By power He crushed the serpent's head,<br>By power God raised Him from the dead.<br><br>The Holy Spirit came<br>On Jesus from above;<br>Not whirlwind then, nor flame<br>Descending like a dove;<br>And lo! from heaven the Father's voice<br>Owned Him in whom He doth rejoice.<br><br>The Saviour Christ the Lord,<br>'Mid guilty sinners came;<br>Maintained the truth of God,<br>Bore grief, reproach, and shame.<br>Unwearied in His love, His grace,<br>He took the guilty sinner's place.<br><br>Alone upon His cross,<br>God's judgment Jesus bore,<br>He paid in full the cost<br>Of glory evermore.<br>His precious blood was freely shed,<br>And Jesus crushed the serpent's head!<br><br>By resurrection now<br>God doth His rights declare,<br>Let men and angels bow<br>To Jesus everywhere,<br>For to this Man, God's Son, is given<br>All power on earth, all power in heaven.<br><br><br>
