Without blood is no remission,<br>Thus the Lord proclaims from heaven,<br>Blood must flow - on this condition,<br>This alone, is sin forgiven;<br>Yes, a victim must be slain,<br>Else all hope of life is vain.<br><br>But the victim - who shall find it,<br>Such a one as sinners need?<br>To the altar who shall bind it,<br>Who shall make the victim bleed?<br>Such a victim as must die.<br>All the world could not supply.<br><br>God Himself provides the victim;<br>Jesus is the Lamb of God;<br>Heaven, and earth, and hell afflict Him<br>While he bears the sinner's load.<br>Jesus' blood - His blood alone,<br>Can for human guilt atone.<br><br>Joyful truth! He bore transgression<br>In His body, on the cross!<br>Through His blood there's full remission<br>For the vilest, e'en for us:<br>Jesus for the sinner bleeds,<br>Nothing more the sinner needs.<br><br><br>
