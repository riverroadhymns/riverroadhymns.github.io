Glory, glory everlasting,<br>Be to Him who bore the Cross,<br>Who redeemed our souls by tasting<br>Death, the death deserved by us!<br>Spread His glory! Spread His glory!<br>Who redeemed His people thus.<br><br>His is love, 'tis love unbounded,<br>Without measure, without end;<br>Human thought is here confounded.<br>'Tis too vast to comprehend!<br>Praise the Saviour! Praise the Saviour!<br>Magnify the sinner's Friend.<br><br>While we hear the wondrous story<br>Of the Saviour's cross and shame,<br>Sing we, "Everlasting glory<br>Be to God and to the Lamb!"<br>Saints and angels, saints and angels,<br>Give ye glory to His name.<br><br><br>
