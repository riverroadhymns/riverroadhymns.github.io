Far, far away in heathen darkness dwelling,<br>Millions of souls for ever may be lost;<br>Who, who will go, salvation's story telling,<br>Looking to Jesus, counting not the cost?<br><br>Chorus<br>"All power is given unto Me!<br>All power is given unto Me!<br>Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel<br>And lo I am with you alway."<br><br>See, o'er the world, wide open doors inviting;<br>Soldiers of Christ, arise and enter in!<br>Christians, awake! your forces all uniting,<br>Send forth the gospel, break the chain of sin!<br><br>Chorus<br>"All power is given unto Me!<br>All power is given unto Me!<br>Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel<br>And lo I am with you alway."<br><br>"Why will ye die?" the voice of God is calling:<br>"Why will ye die?" re-echo in His name;<br>Jesus hath died to save from death appalling,<br>Life and salvation therefore go proclaim.<br><br>Chorus<br>"All power is given unto Me!<br>All power is given unto Me!<br>Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel<br>And lo I am with you alway."<br><br>God speed the day when those of every nation,<br>"Glory to God", triumphantly shall sing.<br>Ransomed, redeemed, rejoicing in salvation,<br>Shout, "Hallelujah, for the Lord is King!"<br><br>Chorus<br>"All power is given unto Me!<br>All power is given unto Me!<br>Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel<br>And lo I am with you alway."<br><br><br>
