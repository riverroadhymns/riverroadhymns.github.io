Take my life, and let it be<br>Consecrated, Lord, to Thee.<br>Take my hands, and let them move<br>At the impulse of Thy love.<br><br>Take my lips, and let them be<br>Filled with messages from Thee.<br>Take my silver and my gold;<br>Not a mite would I withhold.<br><br>Take my moments and my days;<br>Let them flow in ceaseless praise.<br>Take my intellect, and use<br>Every power as Thou shalt choose.<br><br>Take my will, and make it Thine;<br>It shall be no longer mine.<br>Take my heart, it is Thine own;<br>It shall be Thy royal throne.<br><br>Take my love, my Lord, I pour<br>At Thy feet its treasure store.<br>Take myself, and I will be<br>Ever, only, all for Thee.<br><br><br>
