Settled forever! sin's tremendous claim,<br>Glory to Jesus, blessed be His name,<br>No part-way measures doth His grace provide,<br>Finished the work was, when the Saviour died.<br><br>Chorus<br>Settled forever! sin's tremendous claim,<br>Glory to Jesus, blessed be His name.<br><br>Settled forever! fear not then to trust<br>Thy soul upon Him, even as thou must;<br>On Calvary's cross, the claims of God were met;<br>Settled forever all the grievous debt.<br><br>Chorus<br>Settled forever! sin's tremendous claim,<br>Glory to Jesus, blessed be His name.<br><br>Settled forever! let no doubt nor fear<br>Mix with thy love, nor in thy robe appear<br>One single thread of thine own righteousness,<br>We are complete in Him Who came to bless.<br><br>Chorus<br>Settled forever! sin's tremendous claim,<br>Glory to Jesus, blessed be His name.<br><br>Settled forever! yes, no work of thine<br>Nor tears, nor sorrow add to grace divine,<br>God says, "I blot out every sin and stain<br>And will remember them no more again."<br><br>Chorus<br>Settled forever! sin's tremendous claim,<br>Glory to Jesus, blessed be His name.<br><br><br>
