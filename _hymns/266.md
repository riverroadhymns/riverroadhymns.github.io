Once our blessed Christ of beauty<br>Was veiled off from human view;<br>But through suffering death and sorrow<br>He has rent the veil in two.<br><br>Chorus<br>O behold the Man of Sorrows,<br>O behold Him in plain view;<br>Lo! He is the mighty conqueror;<br>Since He rent the veil in two.<br>Lo! He is the mighty conqueror;<br>Since He rent the veil in two.<br><br>Now He is with God the Father,<br>Interceding there for you;<br>For He is the mighty conqueror<br>Since He rent the veil in two.<br><br>Chorus<br>O behold the Man of Sorrows,<br>O behold Him in plain view;<br>Lo! He is the mighty conqueror;<br>Since He rent the veil in two.<br>Lo! He is the mighty conqueror;<br>Since He rent the veil in two.<br><br>Holy angels bow before Him,<br>Men of earth give praises due;<br>For He is the well beloved<br>Since He rent the veil in two.<br><br>Chorus<br>O behold the Man of Sorrows,<br>O behold Him in plain view;<br>Lo! He is the mighty conqueror;<br>Since He rent the veil in two.<br>Lo! He is the mighty conqueror;<br>Since He rent the veil in two.<br><br>Throughout time and endless ages,<br>Heights and depths of love so true;<br>He alone can be the giver<br>Since He rent the veil in two.<br><br>Chorus<br>O behold the Man of Sorrows,<br>O behold Him in plain view;<br>Lo! He is the mighty conqueror;<br>Since He rent the veil in two.<br>Lo! He is the mighty conqueror;<br>Since He rent the veil in two.<br><br><br>
