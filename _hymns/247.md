Crown Him with many crowns,<br>The Lamb upon His throne;<br>Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns<br>All music but its own;<br>Awake, my soul, and sing<br>Of Him who died for thee,<br>And hail Him as thy matchless King<br>Through all eternity.<br><br>Crown Him the Lord of love;<br>Behold His hands and side;<br>Rich wounds, yet visible above<br>In beauty glorified;<br>All hail, Redeemer, hail!<br>For Thou hast died for me.<br>Thy praise shall never, never fail<br>Throughout eternity.<br><br>Crown Him the Lord of life<br>Who triumphed o'er the grave<br>And rose victorious in the strife<br>For those He came to save.<br>His glories now we sing,<br>Who died and rose on high,<br>Who died eternal life to bring<br>And lives that death may die.<br><br>Crown Him the Lord of heaven,<br>Enthroned in worlds above.<br>The King of kings to Whom is given<br>The wondrous name of love.<br>His reign shall know no end<br>And round His pierced feet,<br>Fair flowers of paradise extend<br>Their fragrance ever sweet.<br><br><br>
