Precious, precious blood of Jesus,<br>Shed on Calvary,<br>Shed for rebels, shed for sinners,<br>Shed for me.<br><br>Precious blood that hath redeemed us,<br>All the price is paid!<br>Perfect pardon now is offered,<br>Peace is made.<br><br>Precious, precious blood of Jesus,<br>Let it make thee whole,<br>Let its mighty power in cleansing<br>Reach thy soul.<br><br>Though thy sins are red like crimson,<br>Deep as scarlet glow,<br>Jesus' precious blood can make them<br>White as snow.<br><br>Precious, precious blood of Jesus,<br>Ever flowing free!<br>O, believe it, O receive it!<br>Tis for Thee.<br><br><br>
