O Jesus, I have promised<br>To serve Thee to the end;<br>Be Thou for ever near me,<br>My Master and my friend!<br>I shall not fear the battle<br>If Thou art by my side,<br>Nor wander from the pathway<br>If Thou wilt be my Guide.<br><br>O let me feel Thee near me,<br>The world is ever near;<br>I see the sights that dazzle,<br>The tempting sounds I hear;<br>My foes are ever near me,<br>Around me and within;<br>But, Jesus, draw Thou nearer,<br>And shield my soul from sin.<br><br>O let me hear Thee speaking<br>In accents clear and still,<br>Above the storms of passion,<br>The murmurs of self-will.<br>O speak to reassure me,<br>To hasten or control;<br>O speak, and make me listen,<br>Thou guardian of my soul!<br><br>O Jesus, Thou hast promised<br>To all who follow Thee,<br>That where Thou art in glory<br>There shall Thy servant be;<br>And, Jesus, I have promised<br>To serve Thee to the end;<br>O give me grace to follow,<br>My Master and my friend!<br><br>O let me see Thy footmarks,<br>And in them plant mine own;<br>My hope to follow duly<br>Is in Thy strength alone.<br>O, guide me, call me, draw me,<br>Uphold me to the end;<br>And then in heaven receive me,<br>My Saviour and my friend!<br><br><br>
