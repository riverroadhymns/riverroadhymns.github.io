Time is earnest, passing by,<br>Death is earnest, drawing nigh,<br>Sinner, wilt thou trifling be?<br>Time and death appeal to thee.<br><br>Life is earnest; when 'tis o'er<br>Thou returnest never more;<br>Soon to meet eternity,<br>Will thou never serious be?<br><br>God is earnest, come today,<br>Ere thy season pass away,<br>Ere be set His judgment throne,<br>Vengeance ready, mercy gone.<br><br>Christ is earnest; bids thee come,<br>God declares that all is done;<br>Wilt thou spurn the Saviour's love,<br>Pleading with thee from above?<br><br>O, be earnest! Death is near;<br>Thou wilt perish lingering here.<br>Sleep no longer, rise and flee,<br>Lo, thy Saviour waits for thee!<br><br><br>
