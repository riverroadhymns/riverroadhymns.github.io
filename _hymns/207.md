'Tis a true and faithful saying,<br>Jesus died for sinful men;<br>Though we've told the story often,<br>We must tell it o'er again.<br><br>Chorus<br>O glad and glorious gospel,<br>With joy we now proclaim<br>A full and free salvation,<br>Through faith in Jesus' name.<br><br>He has made a full atonement,<br>Now His saving work is done;<br>He has glorified the Father<br>Who accepts us in His Son.<br><br>Chorus<br>O glad and glorious gospel,<br>With joy we now proclaim<br>A full and free salvation,<br>Through faith in Jesus' name.<br><br>Still upon His hands the nail-prints,<br>And the scars upon His brow:<br>Our Redeemer, Lord, and Saviour,<br>In the glory standeth now.<br><br>Chorus<br>O glad and glorious gospel,<br>With joy we now proclaim<br>A full and free salvation,<br>Through faith in Jesus' name.<br><br>But remember, this same Jesus<br>In the clouds will come again;<br>And with Him His blood-bought people<br>Evermore shall live and reign.<br><br>Chorus<br>O glad and glorious gospel,<br>With joy we now proclaim<br>A full and free salvation,<br>Through faith in Jesus' name.<br><br><br>
