Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!<br>Thou art the Potter, I am the clay.<br>Mould me and make me after Thy will,<br>While I am waiting, yielded and still.<br><br>Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!<br>Search me and try me, Master, today!<br>Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,<br>As in Thy presence humbly bow.<br><br>Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!<br>Wounded and weary, help me, I pray!<br>Power, all power, surely is Thine!<br>Touch me and heal me, Saviour divine!<br><br>Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!<br>Hold o'er my being absolute sway!<br>Fill with Thy Spirit till all shall see<br>Christ only, always, living in me!<br><br><br>
