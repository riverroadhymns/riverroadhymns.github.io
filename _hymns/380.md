Hark! 'tis the Shepherd's voice I hear,<br>Out in the desert dark and drear,<br>Calling the sheep who've gone astray,<br>Far from the Shepherd's fold away.<br><br>Chorus<br>Bring them in, bring them in!<br>Bring them in from the fields of sin;<br>Bring them in, bring them in!<br>Bring the wandering ones to Jesus.<br><br>Who'll go and help this Shepherd kind,<br>Help Him the wandering ones to find?<br>Who'll bring the lost ones to the fold,<br>Where they'll be sheltered from the cold?<br><br>Chorus<br>Bring them in, bring them in!<br>Bring them in from the fields of sin;<br>Bring them in, bring them in!<br>Bring the wandering ones to Jesus.<br><br>Out in the desert hear their cry,<br>Out on the mountain wild and high,<br>Hark! 'tis the Master speaks to thee:<br>"Go, find My sheep where'er they be."<br><br>Chorus<br>Bring them in, bring them in!<br>Bring them in from the fields of sin;<br>Bring them in, bring them in!<br>Bring the wandering ones to Jesus.<br><br><br>
