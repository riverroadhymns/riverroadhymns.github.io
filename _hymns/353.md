When all my labours and trials are o'er,<br>And I am safe on that beautiful shore,<br>Just to be near the dear Lord I adore,<br>Will through the ages be glory for me.<br><br>Chorus<br>O, that will be glory for me,<br>Glory for me! Glory for me!<br>When by His grace I shall look on His face,<br>That will be glory, be glory for me!<br><br>When by the gift of His infinite grace<br>I am accorded in heaven a place.<br>Just to be there and to look on His face,<br>Will through the ages be glory for me.<br><br>Chorus<br>O, that will be glory for me,<br>Glory for me! Glory for me!<br>When by His grace I shall look on His face,<br>That will be glory, be glory for me!<br><br>Friends will be there I have loved long ago;<br>Joy like a river around me will flow;<br>Yet, just a smile from my Saviour, I know,<br>Will through the ages be glory for me.<br><br>Chorus<br>O, that will be glory for me,<br>Glory for me! Glory for me!<br>When by His grace I shall look on His face,<br>That will be glory, be glory for me!<br><br><br>
