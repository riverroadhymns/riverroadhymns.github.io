Come, every soul by sin oppressed,<br>There's mercy with the Lord;<br>And He will surely give you rest,<br>By trusting in His word.<br><br>Chorus<br>Only trust Him! Only trust Him!<br>Only trust Him now!<br>He will save you! He will save you!<br>He will save you now!<br><br>For Jesus shed His precious blood,<br>Rich blessings to bestow:<br>It brings the sinner nigh to God<br>And washes white as snow.<br><br>Chorus<br>Only trust Him! Only trust Him!<br>Only trust Him now!<br>He will save you! He will save you!<br>He will save you now!<br><br>Yes, Jesus is the Truth, the Way<br>That leads you into rest;<br>Believe in Him without delay,<br>And you are fully blest.<br><br>Chorus<br>Only trust Him! Only trust Him!<br>Only trust Him now!<br>He will save you! He will save you!<br>He will save you now!<br><br><br>
