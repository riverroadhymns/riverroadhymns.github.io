What a friend we have in Jesus,<br>All our sins and griefs to bear;<br>What a privilege to carry<br>Everything to God in prayer!<br>O! what peace we often forfeit,<br>O! what needless pain we bear,<br>All because we do not carry<br>Everything to God in prayer.<br><br>Have we trials and temptations?<br>Is there trouble anywhere?<br>We should never be discouraged,<br>Take it to the Lord in prayer.<br>Can we find a friend so faithful,<br>Who will all our sorrows share?<br>Jesus knows our every weakness,<br>Take it to the Lord in prayer.<br><br>Are we weak and heavy-laden,<br>Cumbered with a load of care?<br>Blessed Saviour, still our refuge:<br>Take it to the Lord in prayer!<br>Do thy friends despise forsake thee?<br>Take it to the Lord in prayer!<br>In His arms He'll take and shield thee,<br>Thou wilt find a solace there.<br><br>Blessed Jesus, Thou hast promised<br>Thou wilt all our burdens bear;<br>May we ever, Lord, be bringing<br>All to Thee in earnest prayer.<br>Soon in glory, bright, unclouded,<br>There will be no need for prayer;<br>Rapture, praise and endless worship<br>Shall be our sweet portion there.<br><br><br>
