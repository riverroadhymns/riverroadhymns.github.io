Lord Jesus! My Saviour!<br>How vast Thy love to me,<br>I'll bathe in its full ocean<br>To all eternity,<br>And wending on to glory,<br>This all my song shall be,<br>"I was a guilty sinner,<br>But Jesus died for me."<br><br>O Calvary! O Calvary!<br>The thorn-crown and the spear!<br>Tis here Thy love, Lord Jesus,<br>Thy flowing wounds appear;<br>O! depths of grace and mercy,<br>To those dear wounds I flee,<br>"I was a guilty sinner,<br>But Jesus died for me."<br><br>Adore Him, adore Him,<br>The glorious work is done,<br>The Father will not punish me,<br>Twas laid upon His Son;<br>"'Tis finished," cried His suffering soul,<br>And I my title see,<br>"I was a guilty sinner,<br>But Jesus died for me."<br><br>In glory, in glory,<br>"Forever with the Lord,"<br>I'll tune my harp, and with the saints<br>I'll sing with loud accord;<br>And as I strike the golden string,<br>This all my song shall be,<br>"I was a guilty sinner,<br>But Jesus died for me,"<br><br><br>
