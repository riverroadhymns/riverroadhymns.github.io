Have you any room for Jesus,<br>He who bore your load of sin,<br>As He knocks and asks admission,<br>Sinner, will you let Him in?<br><br>Chorus<br>Room for Jesus, King of glory<br>Hasten now, His word obey,<br>Swing the heart's door widely open,<br>Let Him enter while you may.<br><br>Room for pleasure, room for business,<br>But for Christ, the Crucified,<br>Not a place that He can enter,<br>In the heart for which He died.<br><br>Chorus<br>Room for Jesus, King of glory<br>Hasten now, His word obey,<br>Swing the heart's door widely open,<br>Let Him enter while you may.<br><br>Have you any time for Jesus<br>As in grace He calls again;<br>O, today is time accepted.<br>Tomorrow you may call in vain.<br><br>Chorus<br>Room for Jesus, King of glory<br>Hasten now, His word obey,<br>Swing the heart's door widely open,<br>Let Him enter while you may.<br><br>Room and time now give to Jesus,<br>Soon will pass God's day of grace;<br>Soon thy heart left cold and silent,<br>And the Saviour's pleading cease.<br><br>Chorus<br>Room for Jesus, King of glory<br>Hasten now, His word obey,<br>Swing the heart's door widely open,<br>Let Him enter while you may.<br><br><br>
