Stricken, smitten, and afflicted<br>See Him die upon the tree!<br>'Tis the Christ by man rejected,<br>Yes my soul, 'tis He! 'tis He!<br>Many hands were raised to wound Him,<br>None would interpose to save;<br>But the awful stroke that found Him<br>Was the stroke that justice gave.<br><br>Ye who think of sin but lightly,<br>Nor suppose the evil great,<br>Here may view its nature rightly,<br>Here its guilt may estimate.<br>Mark the sacrifice appointed!<br>See who bears the awful load!<br>'Tis the Word, the Lord's Anointed,<br>Son of Man, and Son of God.<br><br>Here we have a firm foundation,<br>Here's the refuge of the lost;<br>Christ the Rock of our salvation;<br>His the Name of which we boast.<br>Lamb of God, for sinners wounded,<br>Sacrificed to cancel guilt!<br>None shall ever be confounded<br>Who on Him their hopes have built.<br><br><br>
