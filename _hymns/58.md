How wondrous a Saviour is God's blessed Son,<br>How great and eternal the work He has done!<br>God's glory maintained by His death on the tree,<br>While mercy flows freely to you and to me.<br><br>How free is the pardon His blood has procured!<br>How blessed the welcome His name has ensured<br>To all who confess Him their Saviour and Lord,<br>Now brought into favour, believing His Word.<br><br>On Calvary see Him, who died in our stead,<br>Exhausting God's judgment, when for us He bled;<br>God's wrath He endured on Calvary's tree,<br>By weakness and dying, the victor was He<br><br>O! why remain distant, when God calls thee near<br>In love that dismisses all bondage and fear<br>O, why remain Christless, when thou may'st be blest<br>O, why remain weary, when Christ giveth rest<br><br>The moments are fleeting; then, haste, nor delay,<br>Secure God's salvation, while still 'tis today;<br>Eternity's ages thy soul has to face<br>In blackness of darkness, or riches of grace.<br><br><br>
