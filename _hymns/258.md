It may be at morn, when the day is awaking,<br>When sunlight through darkness and shadow is breaking,<br>That Jesus will come in the fullness of glory,<br>To receive from the world His own.<br><br>Chorus<br>O Lord Jesus, how long?<br>How long, ere we shout the glad song?<br>Christ returneth! Hallelujah!<br>Hallelujah! Amen!<br>Hallelujah! Amen!<br><br>It may be at midday, it may be at twilight,<br>It may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight<br>Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,<br>When Jesus receives His own.<br><br>Chorus<br>O Lord Jesus, how long?<br>How long, ere we shout the glad song?<br>Christ returneth! Hallelujah!<br>Hallelujah! Amen!<br>Hallelujah! Amen!<br><br>While hosts cry hosanna, from heaven descending,<br>With glorified saints and the angels attending,<br>With grace on His brow, like a halo of glory,<br>Will Jesus receive His own.<br><br>Chorus<br>O Lord Jesus, how long?<br>How long, ere we shout the glad song?<br>Christ returneth! Hallelujah!<br>Hallelujah! Amen!<br>Hallelujah! Amen!<br><br>O, joy! O, delight! should we go without dying!<br>No sickness, no sadness, no dread, and no crying.<br>Caught up through the clouds, with our Lord into glory,<br>When Jesus receives His own.<br><br>Chorus<br>O Lord Jesus, how long?<br>How long, ere we shout the glad song?<br>Christ returneth! Hallelujah!<br>Hallelujah! Amen!<br>Hallelujah! Amen!<br><br><br>
