I know that my Redeemer liveth<br>And on the earth again shall stand;<br>I know eternal life He giveth,<br>That grace and power are in His hand.<br><br>Chorus<br>I know I know that Jesus liveth,<br>And on the earth again shall stand;<br>I know, I know that life He giveth,<br>That grace and power are in His hand.<br><br>I know His promise never faileth,<br>The word He speaks, it cannot die;<br>Though cruel death my flesh assaileth,<br>Yet I shall see Him by and by.<br><br>Chorus<br>I know I know that Jesus liveth,<br>And on the earth again shall stand;<br>I know, I know that life He giveth,<br>That grace and power are in His hand.<br><br>I know my mansion He prepareth<br>That where He is, there I may be;<br>O wondrous thought! for me He careth,<br>And He at last will come for me.<br><br>Chorus<br>I know I know that Jesus liveth,<br>And on the earth again shall stand;<br>I know, I know that life He giveth,<br>That grace and power are in His hand.<br><br><br>
