Without Him I could do nothing,<br>Without Him I'd surely fail;<br>Without Him I would be drifting<br>Like a ship without a sail.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus, O Jesus!<br>Do you know Him today?<br>Do not turn Him away.<br>O Jesus, O Jesus,<br>Without Him, how lost I would be.<br><br>Without Him I would be dying,<br>Without Him I'd be enslaved;<br>Without Him life would be hopeless,<br>But with Jesus, thank God, I'm saved.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus, O Jesus!<br>Do you know Him today?<br>Do not turn Him away.<br>O Jesus, O Jesus,<br>Without Him, how lost I would be.<br><br><br>
