There's a royal banner given for display<br>To the soldiers of the King;<br>As an ensign fair we lift it up today,<br>While as ransomed ones we sing.<br><br>Chorus<br>Marching On! Marching on!<br>For Christ count everything but loss;<br>And to crown Him King, toil and sing,<br>Neath the banner of the cross!<br><br>Though the foe may rage and gather as the flood,<br>Let the standard be displayed!<br>And beneath its folds, as soldiers of the Lord,<br>For the truth be not dismayed!<br><br>Chorus<br>Marching On! Marching on!<br>For Christ count everything but loss;<br>And to crown Him King, toil and sing,<br>Neath the banner of the cross!<br><br>Over land and sea, wherever man may dwell<br>Make the glorious tidings known<br>Of the crimson banner, now the story tell,<br>While the Lord shall claim His own.<br><br>Chorus<br>Marching On! Marching on!<br>For Christ count everything but loss;<br>And to crown Him King, toil and sing,<br>Neath the banner of the cross!<br><br>When the glory dawns - 'tis drawing very near;<br>It is hastening day by day,<br>Then before our King the foe shall disappear<br>And the cross the world shall sway!<br><br>Chorus<br>Marching On! Marching on!<br>For Christ count everything but loss;<br>And to crown Him King, toil and sing,<br>Neath the banner of the cross!<br><br><br>
