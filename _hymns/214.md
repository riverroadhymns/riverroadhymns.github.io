We love to sing of the Lord who died,<br>And His wondrous love proclaim;<br>How there's life and peace through the Crucified,<br>And salvation through His name.<br><br>Chorus<br>Salvation! Salvation! vast, full and free;<br>Through the precious blood of the Son of God,<br>Who was slain on Calvary.<br><br>O, the height and depth of His boundless love<br>And His mercy who can tell,<br>When He came to the Cross from the throne above,<br>To save our souls from hell!<br><br>Chorus<br>Salvation! Salvation! vast, full and free;<br>Through the precious blood of the Son of God,<br>Who was slain on Calvary.<br><br>Our sins and guilt were upon Him laid,<br>He the wrath of God endured,<br>By His precious blood an atonement made,<br>And our full discharge procured.<br><br>Chorus<br>Salvation! Salvation! vast, full and free;<br>Through the precious blood of the Son of God,<br>Who was slain on Calvary.<br><br>Ascended now to God's right hand,<br>A conqueror o'er the grave,<br>He bids us tell through every land,<br>His mighty power to save.<br><br>Chorus<br>Salvation! Salvation! vast, full and free;<br>Through the precious blood of the Son of God,<br>Who was slain on Calvary.<br><br><br>
