Why should I feel discouraged,<br>Why should the shadows come,<br>Why should my heart be lonely,<br>And long for heaven and home,<br>When Jesus is my portion,<br>My constant friend is He;<br>His eye is on the sparrow<br>And I know He watches me;<br>His eye is on the sparrow,<br>And I know He watches me.<br><br>Chorus<br>I sing because I'm happy,<br>I sing because I'm free<br>For His eye is on the sparrow<br>And I know He watches me.<br><br>"Let not your heart be troubled,"<br>His tender word I hear,<br>And resting on His goodness,<br>I lose my doubts and fears;<br>Though by the path He leadeth.<br>But one step I may see;<br>His eye is on the sparrow,<br>And I know He watches me;<br>His eye is on the sparrow<br>And I know He watches me.<br><br>Chorus<br>I sing because I'm happy,<br>I sing because I'm free<br>For His eye is on the sparrow<br>And I know He watches me.<br><br>Whenever I am tempted,<br>Whenever clouds arise,<br>When songs give place to sighing,<br>When hope within me dies,<br>I draw the closer to Him,<br>From care He sets me free;<br>His eye is on the sparrow,<br>And I know He watches me;<br>His eye is on the sparrow,<br>And I know He watches me.<br><br>Chorus<br>I sing because I'm happy,<br>I sing because I'm free<br>For His eye is on the sparrow<br>And I know He watches me.<br><br><br>
