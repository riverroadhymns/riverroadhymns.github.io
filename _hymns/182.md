There is a Book, a holy Book,<br>By God to sinners given,<br>To show the way of life and peace<br>And mark the path to heaven.<br><br>It tells me of my lost estate,<br>All guilty and defiled:<br>It says I must be born of God<br>Ere I can be His child.<br><br>It tells me of the Lamb of God,<br>Who died upon the tree,<br>To bear the wrath and curse of God<br>And set the sinner free.<br><br>This Book shall be my early guide,<br>My lamp to give me light,<br>My spring of joy in life's glad day,<br>My comfort in its night.<br><br><br>
