So send I you to labour unrewarded,<br>To serve unpaid, unloved, unsought, unknown,<br>To bear rebuke, to suffer scorn and suffering,<br>So send I you to toil for Me alone.<br><br>So send I you to bind the bruised and broken,<br>O'er wandering souls to work, to weep, to wake,<br>To bear the burdens of a world a-weary,<br>So send I you to suffer for My sake.<br><br>So send I you to loneliness and longing,<br>With heart a-hungering for the loved and known,<br>Forsaking home and kindred, friend and dear one,<br>So send I you to know My love alone.<br><br>So send I you to leave your life's ambition,<br>To die to dear desire, self-will resign,<br>To labour long and love where men revile you,<br>So send I you to lose your life in Mine.<br><br>So send I you to hearts made hard by hatred,<br>To eyes made blind because they will not see,<br>To spend, though it be blood, to spend and spare not,<br>So send I you to tell of Calvary.<br><br><br>
