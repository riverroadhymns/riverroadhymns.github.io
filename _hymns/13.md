Behold, the manner of God's love<br>On the cross! On the cross!<br>Expressed in deeds, all words above,<br>On the cross! On the cross!<br>The world with all its wealth were vain<br>To ransom souls from sin's dark stain;<br>Blood only could remission gain,<br>By the cross! By the cross!<br><br>Behold the measure of God's love<br>On the cross! On the cross!<br>There, there He did its greatness prove,<br>On the cross! On the cross!<br>O, what can with such love compare<br>There Jesus did God's love declare,<br>And all the weight of judgment bear<br>On the cross! On the cross!<br><br>Behold the fullness of God's love<br>On the cross! On the cross!<br>His love to all He then did prove,<br>On the cross! On the cross!<br>No greater gift could He bestow,<br>To show His love to man below;<br>Through His own Son doth mercy flow,<br>By the cross! By the cross!<br><br><br>
