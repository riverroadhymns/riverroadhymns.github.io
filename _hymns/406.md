Work, for the night is coming,<br>Work through the morning hours;<br>Work while the dew is sparkling,<br>Work 'mid springing flowers;<br>Work when the day grows brighter,<br>Under the glowing sun;<br>Work, for the night is coming,<br>When man's work is done.<br><br>Work, for the night is coming,<br>Work through the sunny noon;<br>Fill the bright hours with labour,<br>Rest comes sure and soon,<br>Give to each flying minute<br>Something to keep in store;<br>Work, for the night is coming,<br>When man works no more.<br><br>Work, for the night is coming,<br>Under the sunset skies;<br>While their bright tints are glowing,<br>Work for daylight flies.<br>Work till the last beam fadeth.<br>Fadeth to shine no more;<br>Work while the night is darkening,<br>When man's work is o'er.<br><br><br>
