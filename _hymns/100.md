My faith has found a resting place,<br>Not in device or creed;<br>I trust the ever-living One,<br>His wounds for me shall plead.<br><br>Chorus<br>I need no other argument,<br>I need no other plea,<br>It is enough that Jesus died,<br>And that He died for me.<br><br>Enough for me that Jesus saves,<br>This ends my fear and doubt;<br>A sinful soul I come to Him,<br>He'll never cast me out.<br><br>Chorus<br>I need no other argument,<br>I need no other plea,<br>It is enough that Jesus died,<br>And that He died for me.<br><br>My heart is leaning on the Word,<br>The written Word of God,<br>Salvation by my Saviour's name,<br>Salvation through His blood.<br><br>Chorus<br>I need no other argument,<br>I need no other plea,<br>It is enough that Jesus died,<br>And that He died for me.<br><br>My great Physician heals the sick,<br>The lost He came to save;<br>For me His precious blood He shed,<br>For me His life He gave.<br><br>Chorus<br>I need no other argument,<br>I need no other plea,<br>It is enough that Jesus died,<br>And that He died for me.<br><br><br>
