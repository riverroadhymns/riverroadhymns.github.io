I have seen the cross of Jesus,<br>Gazed upon the Crucified:<br>And my heart is won for ever,<br>I am saved and satisfied.<br><br>Chorus<br>Earth's joys no longer charm me,<br>And the world has lost its hold,<br>But my heart will sing with gladness<br>When the pearly gates unfold.<br><br>I had sought in worldly pleasure<br>To forget eternity,<br>Thus, unsatisfied and weary,<br>I was brought to Calvary.<br><br>Chorus<br>Earth's joys no longer charm me,<br>And the world has lost its hold,<br>But my heart will sing with gladness<br>When the pearly gates unfold.<br><br>O, the wondrous love of Jesus,<br>Not the half hath yet been told,<br>I shall know it in its fullness,<br>When the pearly gates unfold.<br><br>Chorus<br>Earth's joys no longer charm me,<br>And the world has lost its hold,<br>But my heart will sing with gladness<br>When the pearly gates unfold.<br><br><br>
