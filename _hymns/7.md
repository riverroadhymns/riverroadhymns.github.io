And can it be that I should gain<br>An interest in the Saviour's blood<br>Died He for me, who caused His pain<br>For me, who Him to death pursued<br>Amazing love! how can it be<br>That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me<br><br>Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies!<br>Who can explore His strange design<br>In vain the first-born seraph tries<br>To sound the depths of love divine.<br>Tis mercy all! let earth adore,<br>Let angel minds inquire no more.<br><br>He left His Father's throne above,<br>So free, so infinite His grace;<br>Humbled Himself and in His love<br>He bled for Adam's helpless race;<br>Tis mercy all, immense and free;<br>For, O my God, it found out me.<br><br>Long my imprisoned spirit lay<br>Fast bound in sin and nature's night;<br>Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,<br>I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;<br>My chains fell off, my heart was free;<br>I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.<br><br>No condemnation now I dread;<br>Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!<br>Alive in Him, my living Head,<br>And clothed in righteousness divine,<br>Bold I approach the eternal throne<br>And claim the crown, through Christ my own.<br><br><br>
