I was once far away from the Saviour,<br>As vile as a sinner could be;<br>And I wondered if Christ the Redeemer<br>Could save a poor sinner like me.<br><br>I wandered on in the darkness,<br>Not a ray of light could I see;<br>And the thought filled my heart with sadness,<br>There's no hope for a sinner like me.<br><br>And then, in that dark lonely hour,<br>A voice sweetly whispered to me,<br>Saying, "Christ the Redeemer hath power<br>To save a poor sinner like thee."<br><br>I then fully trusted in Jesus:<br>And O! what a joy came to me!<br>My heart was filled with His praises<br>For saving a sinner like me.<br><br>No longer in darkness I'm walking,<br>The light is now shining on me<br>And now unto others I'm telling<br>How He saved a poor sinner like me.<br><br>And when life's journey is over<br>And I the dear Saviour shall see,<br>I'll praise Him for ever and ever,<br>For saving a sinner like me.<br><br>And now while I walk in the valley,<br>May Jesus be precious to me,<br>Till the morn I shall rise to adore Him<br>Who has saved a poor sinner like me.<br><br><br>
