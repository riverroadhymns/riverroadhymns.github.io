Sing the wondrous love of Jesus,<br>Sing His mercy and His grace;<br>In the mansions, bright and blessed,<br>He'll prepare for us a place.<br><br>Chorus<br>When we all get to heaven,<br>What a day of rejoicing that will be!<br>When we all see Jesus,<br>We'll sing and shout the victory.<br><br>While we walk the pilgrim pathway,<br>Clouds will overspread the sky;<br>But when travelling days are over,<br>Not a shadow, not a sigh.<br><br>Chorus<br>When we all get to heaven,<br>What a day of rejoicing that will be!<br>When we all see Jesus,<br>We'll sing and shout the victory.<br><br>Let us, then, be true and faithful,<br>Trusting, serving every day;<br>Just one glimpse of Him in glory<br>Will the toils of life repay.<br><br>Chorus<br>When we all get to heaven,<br>What a day of rejoicing that will be!<br>When we all see Jesus,<br>We'll sing and shout the victory.<br><br>Onward to the prize before us!<br>Soon His beauty we'll behold;<br>Soon the pearly gates will open,<br>We shall tread the street of gold.<br><br>Chorus<br>When we all get to heaven,<br>What a day of rejoicing that will be!<br>When we all see Jesus,<br>We'll sing and shout the victory.<br><br><br>
