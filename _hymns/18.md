Calvary's cross is, to the sinner,<br>All his hope, and all his stay,<br>Hoary head or young beginner,<br>Rich or poor may come today.<br><br>Chorus<br>Calvary's cross, the only refuge!<br>Calvary's cross, the only plea!<br>Calvary's cross! O, blessed shelter!<br>On it God's salvation see!<br><br>Calvary's cross, no other token<br>Will or can Jehovah give;<br>Hanging there, of Christ 'tis spoken,<br>"Look to Him and, looking, live."<br><br>Chorus<br>Calvary's cross, the only refuge!<br>Calvary's cross, the only plea!<br>Calvary's cross! O, blessed shelter!<br>On it God's salvation see!<br><br>Calvary's cross, 'tis God's one answer,<br>Tears nor groans can e'er avail,<br>All who on its fullness venture,<br>Must eternally prevail.<br><br>Chorus<br>Calvary's cross, the only refuge!<br>Calvary's cross, the only plea!<br>Calvary's cross! O, blessed shelter!<br>On it God's salvation see!<br><br>Calvary's cross, the sight how glorious,<br>Jesus dies yet triumphs there!<br>And for all the saved victorious,<br>Wins a home in heaven, so fair.<br><br>Chorus<br>Calvary's cross, the only refuge!<br>Calvary's cross, the only plea!<br>Calvary's cross! O, blessed shelter!<br>On it God's salvation see!<br><br><br>
