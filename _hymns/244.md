Bright in the glory, where my Lord has gone before;<br>Safe in the glory, to go out no more!<br>I shall soon be sheltered, with His likeness satisfied,<br>All my thoughts concentered on the Glorified.<br>Jesus, Lord Jesus! Thou art All-in-all to me!<br>Jesus, Lord Jesus! All my joy's in Thee!<br><br>Soon in the glory, I shall see my Lord who died!<br>Throned in the glory, lives the Crucified:<br>Lightly weighs life's burden, as I journey gladly on;<br>Precious is my guerdon, Christ the risen One.<br>Jesus, Lord Jesus! Thou art All-in-all to me!<br>Jesus, Lord Jesus! I would live to Thee!<br><br>There in the glory we shall gather every one;<br>Loud in the glory raise the joyful song;<br>Unto Him who loved us, never-ceasing praise be given,<br>Sing we hallelujah to the Lord of heaven.<br>Jesus, Lord Jesus! praise and glory be to Thee!<br>Jesus, Lord Jesus! we shall reign with Thee!<br><br><br>
