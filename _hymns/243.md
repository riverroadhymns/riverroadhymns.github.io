And did the Holy and the Just,<br>The Sovereign of the skies,<br>Stoop down to wretchedness and dust,<br>That guilty worms might rise?<br><br>Chorus<br>Out of the ivory palaces<br>Into a world of woe,<br>Only His great eternal love<br>Made my Saviour go!<br><br>Yes, the Redeemer left His throne,<br>His radiant throne on high,<br>Surpassing mercy, love unknown!<br>To suffer, bleed and die.<br><br>Chorus<br>Out of the ivory palaces<br>Into a world of woe,<br>Only His great eternal love<br>Made my Saviour go!<br><br>He took the ruined sinner's place,<br>And suffered in his stead:<br>For man, O miracle of grace!<br>For man the Saviour bled.<br><br>Chorus<br>Out of the ivory palaces<br>Into a world of woe,<br>Only His great eternal love<br>Made my Saviour go!<br><br>Jesus! my soul adoring bends<br>To love, so full, so free;<br>Though vile I am, that love extends<br>Its sacred power to me.<br><br>Chorus<br>Out of the ivory palaces<br>Into a world of woe,<br>Only His great eternal love<br>Made my Saviour go!<br><br>What glad return can I impart<br>For favours so divine?<br>O, take my all, my weary heart<br>And make it only Thine.<br><br>Chorus<br>Out of the ivory palaces<br>Into a world of woe,<br>Only His great eternal love<br>Made my Saviour go!<br><br><br>
