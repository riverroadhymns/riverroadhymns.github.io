We have heard the joyful sound:<br>Jesus saves! Jesus saves!<br>Tell the message all around:<br>Jesus saves! Jesus saves!<br>Bear the news to every land,<br>Climb the steeps and cross the waves,<br>Onward, 'tis our Lord's command:<br>Jesus saves! Jesus saves!<br><br>Waft it on the rolling tide;<br>Jesus saves! Jesus saves!<br>Tell to sinners far and wide:<br>Jesus saves! Jesus saves!<br>Sing, ye islands of the sea!<br>Echo back ye ocean Caves!<br>Earth shall keep her jubilee,<br>Jesus saves! Jesus saves!<br><br>Sing above the toil and strife:<br>Jesus saves! Jesus saves!<br>By His death and endless life,<br>Jesus saves! Jesus saves!<br>Sing it softly through the gloom,<br>When the heart for mercy craves;<br>Sing in triumph o'er the tomb,<br>Jesus saves! Jesus saves!<br><br>Let the trembling sinner hear:<br>Jesus saves! Jesus saves!<br>This will chase away his fear,<br>Jesus saves! Jesus saves!<br>Shout salvation full and free,<br>To every strand that ocean laves<br>This our song of victory,<br>Jesus saves! Jesus saves!<br><br><br>
