Sound the gospel of grace abroad,<br>There's life in the risen Lord!<br>Spread the news of the gift of God,<br>There's life in the risen Lord.<br>God above desires it!<br>Sinful man requires it!<br><br>Chorus<br>Tell it around, let it abound,<br>There's life in the risen Lord.<br><br>All by nature are doomed to die,<br>So saith the Holy Word;<br>Welcome, therefore, the joyful cry,<br>There's life in the risen Lord!<br>Welcome news of gladness,<br>Antidote of sadness.<br><br>Chorus<br>Tell it around, let it abound,<br>There's life in the risen Lord.<br><br>Saints, apostles, and prophets all<br>Published with one accord<br>This deliverance from the fall,<br>This life in the risen Lord!<br>Glory be to Jesus,<br>Who from bondage frees us!<br><br>Chorus<br>Tell it around, let it abound,<br>There's life in the risen Lord.<br><br>Pardon, power and perfect peace,<br>The words of this life afford;<br>Never, then, let the tidings cease,<br>Of life in the risen Lord.<br>Open wide the portal,<br>Unto every mortal.<br><br>Chorus<br>Tell it around, let it abound,<br>There's life in the risen Lord.<br><br><br>
