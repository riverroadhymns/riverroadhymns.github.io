Low in the grave He lay,<br>Jesus, my Saviour!<br>Waiting the coming day,<br>Jesus, my Lord!<br><br>Chorus<br>Up from the grave He arose<br>With a mighty triumph o'er His foes,<br>He arose a victor from the dark domain,<br>And He lives for ever; with His saints to reign,<br>He arose! He arose!<br>Hallelujah, Christ arose!<br><br>Vainly they watch His bed,<br>Jesus, my Saviour!<br>Vainly they seal the dead,<br>Jesus, my Lord!<br><br>Chorus<br>Up from the grave He arose<br>With a mighty triumph o'er His foes,<br>He arose a victor from the dark domain,<br>And He lives for ever; with His saints to reign,<br>He arose! He arose!<br>Hallelujah, Christ arose!<br><br>Death cannot keep his prey,<br>Jesus, my Saviour!<br>He tore the bars away,<br>Jesus, my Lord!<br><br>Chorus<br>Up from the grave He arose<br>With a mighty triumph o'er His foes,<br>He arose a victor from the dark domain,<br>And He lives for ever; with His saints to reign,<br>He arose! He arose!<br>Hallelujah, Christ arose!<br><br><br>
