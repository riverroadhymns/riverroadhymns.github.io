Hark, sinner, while God from on high doth entreat thee,<br>And warnings with accents of mercy doth blend;<br>Give ear to His voice, lest in judgment He meet thee;<br>The harvest is passing, the summer will end.<br><br>Chorus<br>The harvest is passing, the summer will end;<br>The harvest is passing, the summer will end.<br><br>How oft of thy danger and guilt He hath told thee!<br>How oft still the message of mercy doth send!<br>Haste, haste, while He waits in His arms to enfold thee;<br>The harvest is passing, the summer will end.<br><br>Chorus<br>The harvest is passing, the summer will end;<br>The harvest is passing, the summer will end.<br><br>Despised and rejected, at length He may leave thee:<br>What anguish and horror thy bosom will rend!<br>Then haste thee, O sinner, while He will receive thee;<br>The harvest is passing, the summer will end.<br><br>Chorus<br>The harvest is passing, the summer will end;<br>The harvest is passing, the summer will end.<br><br>Ere long, and Jehovah will come in His power;<br>Our God will arise with His foes to contend;<br>Haste, haste thee, O sinner, prepare for that hour;<br>The harvest is passing, the summer will end.<br><br>Chorus<br>The harvest is passing, the summer will end;<br>The harvest is passing, the summer will end.<br><br><br>
