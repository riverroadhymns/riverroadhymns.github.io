Praise the Saviour, ye who know Him!<br>Who can tell how much we owe Him?<br>Gladly let us render to Him<br>All we are and have.<br><br>Jesus is the Name that charms us,<br>He for conflict fits and arms us;<br>Nothing moves, and nothing harms us,<br>When we trust in Him.<br><br>Trust in Him, ye saints, for ever:<br>He is faithful, changing never;<br>Neither force nor guile can sever<br>Those He loves from Him.<br><br>Keep us, Lord, O keep us cleaving<br>To Thyself, and still believing,<br>Till the hour of our receiving<br>Promised joys in heaven.<br><br>Then we shall be where we would be,<br>Then we shall be what we should be,<br>That which is not now, nor could be,<br>Then shall be our own.<br><br><br>
