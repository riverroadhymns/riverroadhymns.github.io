I was sinking deep in sin,<br>Sinking to rise no more,<br>Overwhelmed by guilt within,<br>Mercy I did implore.<br>Then the Master of the sea<br>Heard my despairing cry.<br>Christ my Saviour lifted me,<br>Now safe am I.<br><br>Chorus<br>Love lifted me! Love lifted me!<br>When no one but Christ could help,<br>Love lifted me!<br><br>Souls in danger, look above,<br>Jesus completely saves;<br>He will lift you by His love,<br>Out of the angry waves.<br>He's the Master of the sea,<br>Billows His will obey;<br>He your Saviour wants to be,<br>Be saved today!<br><br>Chorus<br>Love lifted me! Love lifted me!<br>When no one but Christ could help,<br>Love lifted me!<br><br>When the waves of sorrow roll,<br>When I am in distress,<br>Jesus takes my hand in His,<br>Ever He loves to bless.<br>He will every fear dispel,<br>Satisfy every need;<br>All who heed His loving call,<br>Find rest indeed.<br><br>Chorus<br>Love lifted me! Love lifted me!<br>When no one but Christ could help,<br>Love lifted me!<br><br><br>
