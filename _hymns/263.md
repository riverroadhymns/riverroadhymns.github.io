O God of Bethel, by whose hand<br>Thy people still are fed;<br>Who through this weary pilgrimage<br>Hast all our fathers led.<br><br>Our vows, our prayers, we now present<br>Before Thy throne of grace:<br>God of our fathers, be the God<br>Of their succeeding race.<br><br>Through each perplexing path of life<br>Our wandering footsteps guide;<br>Give us each day our daily bread,<br>And raiment lit provide.<br><br>O spread Thy covering wings around,<br>Till all our wanderings cease,<br>And at our Father's loved abode<br>Our souls arrive in peace.<br><br>Such blessings from Thy gracious hand<br>Our humble prayers implore;<br>And Thou shalt be our chosen God,<br>And portion evermore.<br><br><br>
