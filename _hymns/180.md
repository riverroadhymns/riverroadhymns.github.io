The whole world was lost in the darkness of sin;<br>The Light of the world is Jesus;<br>Like sunshine at noonday His glory shone in,<br>The Light of the world is Jesus.<br><br>Chorus<br>Come to the Light, 'tis shining for thee;<br>Sweetly the Light has dawned upon me;<br>Once I was blind, but now I can see;<br>The Light of the world is Jesus.<br><br>No darkness have we who in Jesus abide,<br>The Light of the world is Jesus;<br>We walk in the Light when we follow our Guide,<br>The Light of the world is Jesus.<br><br>Chorus<br>Come to the Light, 'tis shining for thee;<br>Sweetly the Light has dawned upon me;<br>Once I was blind, but now I can see;<br>The Light of the world is Jesus.<br><br>Ye dwellers in darkness with sin-blinded eyes,<br>The Light of the world is Jesus;<br>Go, wash at His bidding, and light will arise,<br>The Light of the world is Jesus.<br><br>Chorus<br>Come to the Light, 'tis shining for thee;<br>Sweetly the Light has dawned upon me;<br>Once I was blind, but now I can see;<br>The Light of the world is Jesus.<br><br>No need of the sunshine in heaven, we're told,<br>The Light of the world is Jesus;<br>The Lamb is the light in the city of gold,<br>The Light of the world is Jesus.<br><br>Chorus<br>Come to the Light, 'tis shining for thee;<br>Sweetly the Light has dawned upon me;<br>Once I was blind, but now I can see;<br>The Light of the world is Jesus.<br><br><br>
