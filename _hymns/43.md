God loved the world of sinners lost<br>And ruined by the fall;<br>Salvation full, at highest cost,<br>He offers free to all.<br><br>Chorus<br>O, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love!<br>The love of God to me;<br>It brought my Saviour from above,<br>To die on Calvary.<br><br>E'en now by faith I claim Him mine,<br>The risen Son of God;<br>Redemption by His death, I find,<br>And cleansing through the blood.<br><br>Chorus<br>O, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love!<br>The love of God to me;<br>It brought my Saviour from above,<br>To die on Calvary.<br><br>Believing souls, rejoicing go,<br>There shall to you be given<br>A glorious foretaste, here below,<br>Of endless life in heaven.<br><br>Chorus<br>O, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love!<br>The love of God to me;<br>It brought my Saviour from above,<br>To die on Calvary.<br><br>Of victory now o'er Satan's power,<br>Let all the ransomed sing,<br>And triumph to their latest hour,<br>Through Christ, our Lord, the King.<br><br>Chorus<br>O, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love!<br>The love of God to me;<br>It brought my Saviour from above,<br>To die on Calvary.<br><br><br>
