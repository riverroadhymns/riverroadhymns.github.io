I know not why God's wondrous grace,<br>To me He hath made known,<br>Nor why - unworthy of such love<br>Redeemed me for His own.<br><br>Chorus<br>But "I know whom I have believed<br>And am persuaded that He is able<br>To keep that which I've committed<br>Unto Him against that day."<br><br>I know not how this saving faith<br>To me He did impart,<br>Nor how believing in His Word,<br>Wrought peace within my heart.<br><br>Chorus<br>But "I know whom I have believed<br>And am persuaded that He is able<br>To keep that which I've committed<br>Unto Him against that day."<br><br>I know not how the Spirit moves<br>Convincing men of sin,<br>Revealing Jesus through the Word,<br>Creating faith in Him.<br><br>Chorus<br>But "I know whom I have believed<br>And am persuaded that He is able<br>To keep that which I've committed<br>Unto Him against that day."<br><br>I know not what of good or ill<br>May be reserved for me,<br>Of weary ways or golden days<br>Before His face I see.<br><br>Chorus<br>But "I know whom I have believed<br>And am persuaded that He is able<br>To keep that which I've committed<br>Unto Him against that day."<br><br>I know not when my Lord shall come,<br>At night or noonday fair,<br>Nor when I'll walk the vale with Him,<br>Or "meet Him in the air."<br><br>Chorus<br>But "I know whom I have believed<br>And am persuaded that He is able<br>To keep that which I've committed<br>Unto Him against that day."<br><br><br>
