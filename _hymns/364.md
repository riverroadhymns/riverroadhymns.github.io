I'm not ashamed to own my Lord<br>Or to defend His cause;<br>Maintain the honour of His Word,<br>The glory of His cross.<br><br>Chorus<br>At the cross, at the cross,<br>Where I first saw the light,<br>And the burden of my heart rolled away,<br>It was there by faith I received my sight,<br>And now l am happy all the day.<br><br>Jesus, my Lord! I know His name,<br>His name is all my trust,<br>Nor will He put my soul to shame,<br>Nor let my hope be lost.<br><br>Chorus<br>At the cross, at the cross,<br>Where I first saw the light,<br>And the burden of my heart rolled away,<br>It was there by faith I received my sight,<br>And now l am happy all the day.<br><br>Firm as His throne His promise stands,<br>And He can well secure<br>What I've committed to His hands,<br>'Till the decisive hour.<br><br>Chorus<br>At the cross, at the cross,<br>Where I first saw the light,<br>And the burden of my heart rolled away,<br>It was there by faith I received my sight,<br>And now l am happy all the day.<br><br>Then will He own my worthless name<br>Before His Father's face;<br>And, in the new Jerusalem,<br>Appoint my soul a place.<br><br>Chorus<br>At the cross, at the cross,<br>Where I first saw the light,<br>And the burden of my heart rolled away,<br>It was there by faith I received my sight,<br>And now l am happy all the day.<br><br><br>
