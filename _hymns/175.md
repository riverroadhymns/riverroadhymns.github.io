The Lamb of God for sinners died,<br>A victim on the tree;<br>He gave Himself a sacrifice,<br>To set the guilty free.<br><br>Chorus<br>I seek no other argument,<br>I want no other plea,<br>It is enough that Jesus died<br>And rose again for me.<br><br>The great Redeemer left the throne,<br>The radiant throne on high,<br>Surprising mercy! love unknown!<br>To suffer, bleed, and die!<br><br>Chorus<br>I seek no other argument,<br>I want no other plea,<br>It is enough that Jesus died<br>And rose again for me.<br><br>He took the guilty sinner's place,<br>And suffered in his stead;<br>For man (O miracle of grace!)<br>For man, the Saviour bled.<br><br>Chorus<br>I seek no other argument,<br>I want no other plea,<br>It is enough that Jesus died<br>And rose again for me.<br><br><br>
