Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,<br>Just to take Him at His word;<br>Just to rest upon His promise,<br>Just to know, "Thus saith the Lord."<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!<br>How I've proved Him o'er and o'er!<br>Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!<br>O, for grace to trust Him more.<br><br>O, how sweet to trust in Jesus,<br>Just to trust His cleansing blood;<br>Just in simple faith to plunge me<br>Neath the healing, cleansing flood.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!<br>How I've proved Him o'er and o'er!<br>Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!<br>O, for grace to trust Him more.<br><br>Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,<br>Just from sin and self to cease;<br>Just from Jesus simply taking<br>Life and rest, and joy and peace.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!<br>How I've proved Him o'er and o'er!<br>Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!<br>O, for grace to trust Him more.<br><br>I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee,<br>Precious Jesus, Saviour, Friend;<br>And I know that Thou art with me,<br>Wilt be with me to the end.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!<br>How I've proved Him o'er and o'er!<br>Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!<br>O, for grace to trust Him more.<br><br><br>
