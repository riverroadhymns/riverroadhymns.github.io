Behold! Behold the Lamb of God<br>On the cross! On the cross!<br>For us He shed His precious blood,<br>On the cross! On the cross!<br>O hear His all-important cry,<br>"Eli, lama sabachthani"<br>Draw near and see the Saviour die,<br>On the cross! On the cross!<br><br>Behold His arms extended wide,<br>On the cross! On the cross!<br>Behold His bleeding hands and side,<br>On the cross! On the cross!<br>The sun withholds its rays of light,<br>The heavens are clothed in shades of night,<br>While Jesus wins the glorious fight,<br>On the cross! On the cross!<br><br>By faith we see Him lifted up,<br>On the cross! on the cross!<br>He drinks, for us the bitter cup,<br>On the cross! On the cross!<br>The rocks do rend, the mountains quake,<br>While Jesus doth atonement make,<br>While Jesus suffers for our sake,<br>on the cross! On the cross!<br><br>And now the mighty deed is done,<br>On the cross! on the cross!<br>The battle fought, the victory won,<br>On the cross! On the cross!<br>To heaven He turns His languid eyes,<br>"'Tis finished" now, the Conqueror cries,<br>Then bows His sacred head and dies,<br>On the cross! On the cross!<br><br><br>
