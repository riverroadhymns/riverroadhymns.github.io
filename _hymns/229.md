Whosoever will!"<br>Send the proclamation over vale and hill;<br>'Tis a loving Saviour calls the wanderer home.<br>"Whosoever will may come."<br><br>Whosoever cometh need not delay,<br>Now the door is open, enter while you may;<br>Jesus is the true, the only Living Way,<br>Whosoever will may come.<br><br>Chorus<br>"Whosoever will! Whosoever will!"<br>Send the proclamation over vale and hill;<br>'Tis a loving Saviour calls the wanderer home.<br>"Whosoever will may come."<br><br>Whosoever will, the promise is secure;<br>Whosoever will, for ever shall endure;<br>Whosoever will - 'tis life for evermore:<br>Whosoever will may come.<br><br>Chorus<br>"Whosoever will! Whosoever will!"<br>Send the proclamation over vale and hill;<br>'Tis a loving Saviour calls the wanderer home.<br>"Whosoever will may come."<br><br><br>
