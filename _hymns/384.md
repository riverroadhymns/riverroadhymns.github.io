I have only one life on this earth<br>And as vapour, 'tis passing away,<br>I must labour for treasures of worth<br>E'er toil ends at the end of the day.<br><br>Chorus<br>Only one life to give,<br>I must never withhold it from God,<br>Only one life to live,<br>I must not miss the "well done" from God,<br><br>Only one life and white is the field,<br>With compassion this great need I view,<br>This one life that I have I will yield<br>And the little I can I will do.<br><br>Chorus<br>Only one life to give,<br>I must never withhold it from God,<br>Only one life to live,<br>I must not miss the "well done" from God,<br><br>This one life that I have I may lose<br>And in losing a hundredfold gain,<br>Then my all on the altar I'll choose<br>And be broken, God's best to obtain.<br><br>Chorus<br>Only one life to give,<br>I must never withhold it from God,<br>Only one life to live,<br>I must not miss the "well done" from God,<br><br>One poor life, small the offering at best,<br>Yet the world and the flesh often call,<br>This my answer must be to each test,<br>I'll not serve God with less than my all.<br><br>Chorus<br>Only one life to give,<br>I must never withhold it from God,<br>Only one life to live,<br>I must not miss the "well done" from God,<br><br><br>
