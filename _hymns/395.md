Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness,<br>Sowing in the noontide, and the dewy eve,<br>Waiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping,<br>We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.<br><br>Chorus<br>Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,<br>We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.<br><br>Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,<br>Fearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze;<br>By and by the harvest, and the labour ended,<br>We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.<br><br>Chorus<br>Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,<br>We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.<br><br>Go then, ever weeping, sowing for the Master,<br>Though the loss sustained our spirit often grieves;<br>When our weeping's over, He will bid us welcome,<br>We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.<br><br>Chorus<br>Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,<br>We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.<br><br><br>
