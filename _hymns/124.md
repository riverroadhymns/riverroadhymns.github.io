O! What a glorious truth is this,<br>Jesus died.<br>He opened up the path of bliss,<br>Jesus died.<br>God loved the world, His Son He gave,<br>That all who do in Him believe<br>Should full and gracious pardon have,<br>Jesus died.<br><br>To save our souls from death and hell,<br>Jesus died.<br>Such love amazing, who can tell<br>Jesus died.<br>Yes, He for ruined men was slain,<br>That they through Him might life obtain<br>And everlasting glory gain,<br>Jesus died.<br><br>O! Tell it unto all around,<br>Jesus died.<br>Tis such a precious, blessed sound,<br>Jesus died.<br>Entreat poor sinners to rely<br>On that which brings the guilty nigh;<br>E'en to the blood of Christ to fly,<br>Jesus died.<br><br>Soon heaven shall raise the happy song,<br>Jesus died.<br>Which endless ages shall prolong;<br>Jesus died.<br>By virtue of that precious blood,<br>Believers are brought nigh to God;<br>O! Spread the glorious news abroad,<br>Jesus died.<br><br><br>
