Until I heard of Jesus' love,<br>A sinner, Lord, was I;<br>I had no thought of things above,<br>I was afraid to die.<br><br>Chorus<br>I now believe, I do believe,<br>That Jesus died for me,<br>That on the cross He shed His blood,<br>From sin to set me free.<br><br>But when I saw Thee on the cross,<br>All wounded there for me,<br>My very heart I thought would break,<br>I felt I must love Thee.<br><br>Chorus<br>I now believe, I do believe,<br>That Jesus died for me,<br>That on the cross He shed His blood,<br>From sin to set me free.<br><br>My eyes were filled with burning tears,<br>For pardon then I cried<br>But Jesus quickly quelled my fears;<br>He said, "For thee I died."<br><br>Chorus<br>I now believe, I do believe,<br>That Jesus died for me,<br>That on the cross He shed His blood,<br>From sin to set me free.<br><br>I know that God, for Jesus' sake,<br>My sin has washed away;<br>Now should I die, in heaven I'll wake,<br>And sing through endless day!<br><br>Chorus<br>I now believe, I do believe,<br>That Jesus died for me,<br>That on the cross He shed His blood,<br>From sin to set me free.<br><br><br>
