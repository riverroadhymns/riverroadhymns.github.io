Sowing the seed by the daylight fair,<br>Sowing the seed by the noonday glare;<br>Sowing the seed by the fading light,<br>Sowing the seed in the solemn night,<br>O, what shall the harvest be?<br>O, what shall the harvest be?<br><br>Chorus<br>Sown in the darkness, or sown in the light,<br>Sown in our weakness, or sown in our might;<br>Gathered in time or eternity.<br>Sure, ah, sure will the harvest be!<br><br>Sowing the seed by the wayside high,<br>Sowing the Seed on the rocks to die;<br>Sowing the seed where the thorns will spoil,<br>Sowing the seed in the fertile soil,<br>O, what shall the harvest be?<br>O, what shall the harvest be?<br><br>Chorus<br>Sown in the darkness, or sown in the light,<br>Sown in our weakness, or sown in our might;<br>Gathered in time or eternity.<br>Sure, ah, sure will the harvest be!<br><br>Sowing the seed with an aching heart,<br>Sowing the seed while the teardrops start,<br>Sowing in hope till the reapers come,<br>Gladly to gather the harvest home,<br>O, what shall the harvest be?<br>O, what shall the harvest be?<br><br>Chorus<br>Sown in the darkness, or sown in the light,<br>Sown in our weakness, or sown in our might;<br>Gathered in time or eternity.<br>Sure, ah, sure will the harvest be!<br><br><br>
