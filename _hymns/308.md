I've found a Friend, O such a Friend!<br>He loved me ere I knew Him;<br>He drew me with the cords of love,<br>And thus He bound me to Him.<br>And round my heart still closely twine<br>Those ties which nought can sever;<br>For I am His and He is mine<br>For ever and for ever.<br><br>I've found a Friend, O such a Friend!<br>He bled, He died to save me;<br>And not alone the gift of life,<br>But His own self He gave me.<br>Nought that I have mine own I'll call;<br>I'll hold it for the Giver;<br>My heart, my strength, my life, my all,<br>Are His, and His for ever.<br><br>I've found a Friend, O such a Friend!<br>All power to Him is given<br>To guard me on my onward course<br>And bring me safe to heaven.<br>The eternal glories gleam afar,<br>To nerve my faint endeavour;<br>So now to watch, to work, to war,<br>And then to rest for ever.<br><br>I've found a Friend, O such a Friend!<br>So kind, and true, and tender;<br>So. wise a counselor and guide,<br>So mighty a defender!<br>From Him who loves me now so well,<br>What power my soul can sever?<br>Shall life or death, shall earth or hell?<br>No, I am His for ever.<br><br><br>
