Praise the Lord and leave tomorrow<br>In thy loving Father's hands;<br>Burden not thyself with sorrow,<br>For secure the promise stands:<br>He is faithful! He is faithful!<br>Leave thy troubles in His hands.<br><br>Trust today and leave tomorrow,<br>Each day has enough of care;<br>Therefore, whatsoe'er thy burden,<br>God will give thee strength to bear.<br>He is faithful! He is faithful!<br>Cast on Him thine every care.<br><br>Pray today and let tomorrow<br>Bring with it whate'er it may;<br>Hear thy loving Father promise<br>Strength according to thy day.<br>He is faithful! He is faithful!<br>Trust Him, therefore, come what may.<br><br>Watch today, and leave tomorrow,<br>For tomorrow may not come;<br>For today thy loving Saviour<br>May appear to take thee home.<br>He is faithful! He is faithful!<br>Look for Him, the coming One.<br><br>Work today, and leave tomorrow;<br>All around there's urgent need;<br>All around there's sin and sorrow;<br>Broadcast daily, sow thy seed.<br>God is faithful! God is faithful!<br>He shall bless thy work indeed.<br><br>Thus by trusting, watching, praying,<br>Each day, as our time rolls on,<br>We shall had the promised blessing,<br>Daily strength till Jesus come.<br>He is faithful! He is faithful!<br>He will come to take us home.<br><br><br>
