From whence this fear and unbelief,<br>If God, my Father, put to grief<br>His spotless Son for me<br>Can He, the righteous Judge of men,<br>Condemn me for that debt of sin,<br>Which, Lord, was charged to Thee<br><br>Complete atonement Thou hast made,<br>And to the utmost farthing paid,<br>Whate'er Thy people owed;<br>How, then, can wrath on me take place,<br>Now standing in God's righteousness,<br>And sprinkled by Thy blood<br><br>If Thou hast my discharge procured,<br>And freely in my place endured<br>The whole of wrath divine,<br>Payment, God will not twice demand,<br>First at my bleeding Surety's hand,<br>And then again at mine.<br><br>Turn, then, my soul, unto thy rest,<br>The merits of thy great High Priest<br>Speak peace and liberty!<br>Trust in His efficacious blood,<br>Nor fear thy banishment from God,<br>Since Jesus died for thee!<br><br><br>
