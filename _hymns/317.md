Loved with everlasting love,<br>Led by grace that love to know;<br>Spirit, breathing from above,<br>Thou hast taught me it is so!<br>O this full and perfect peace!<br>O this transport all divine!<br>In a love which cannot cease,<br>I am His, and He is mine.<br><br>Heaven above is softer blue,<br>Earth around is sweeter green!<br>Something lives in every hue<br>Christless eyes have never seen.<br>Birds with gladder songs o'erflow,<br>Flowers with deeper beauties shine,<br>Since I know, as now I know,<br>I am His, and He is mine.<br><br>Things that once were wild alarms<br>Cannot now disturb my rest;<br>Closed in everlasting arms,<br>Pillowed on the loving breast.<br>O to lie for ever here,<br>Doubt and care and self resign,<br>While He whispers in my ear,<br>I am His, and He is mine!<br><br>His for ever, only His;<br>Who the Lord and me shall part?<br>Ah, with what a rest of bliss<br>Christ can fill the loving heart!<br>Heaven and earth may fade and flee,<br>First-born light in gloom decline;<br>But while God and I shall be,<br>I am His, and He is mine.<br><br><br>
