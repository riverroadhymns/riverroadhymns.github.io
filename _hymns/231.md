Will you come, will you come<br>With your poor broken heart,<br>Burdened and sin oppressed?<br>Lay it down at the feet<br>Of the Saviour and Lord,<br>Jesus will give you rest.<br><br>Chorus<br>O happy rest, sweet happy rest,<br>Jesus will give you rest.<br>O! Why won't you come in simple trusting faith?<br>Jesus will give you rest.<br><br>Will you come, will you come?<br>There is mercy for you,<br>Balm for your aching breast;<br>Only come as you are<br>And believe on His name,<br>Jesus will give you rest.<br><br>Chorus<br>O happy rest, sweet happy rest,<br>Jesus will give you rest.<br>O! Why won't you come in simple trusting faith?<br>Jesus will give you rest.<br><br>Will you come, will you come?<br>You have nothing to pay;<br>Jesus, who loves you best,<br>By His death on the Cross<br>Purchased life for your soul;<br>Jesus will give you rest.<br><br>Chorus<br>O happy rest, sweet happy rest,<br>Jesus will give you rest.<br>O! Why won't you come in simple trusting faith?<br>Jesus will give you rest.<br><br>Will you come, will you come?<br>How He pleads with you now!<br>Fly to His loving breast<br>And whatever your sin<br>Or your sorrow may be,<br>Jesus will give you rest.<br><br>Chorus<br>O happy rest, sweet happy rest,<br>Jesus will give you rest.<br>O! Why won't you come in simple trusting faith?<br>Jesus will give you rest.<br><br><br>
