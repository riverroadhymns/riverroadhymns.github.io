Saviour, Thy dying love Thou gavest me,<br>Nor should I aught withhold, My Lord, from Thee;<br>In love my soul would bow,<br>My heart fulfill its vow,<br>Some offering bring Thee now,<br>Something for Thee.<br><br>At the blest mercy-seat pleading for me,<br>My feeble faith looks up, Saviour, to Thee;<br>Help me the cross to bear,<br>Thy wondrous love declare,<br>Some song to raise, or prayer,<br>Something for Thee.<br><br>Give me a faithful heart, likeness to Thee;<br>That each departing day henceforth may see<br>Some work of love begun,<br>Some deed of kindness done,<br>Some wanderer sought and won,<br>Something for Thee.<br><br>All that I am and have - Thy gifts so free,<br>In joy, in grief, through life, O Lord, for Thee!<br>And when Thy face I see,<br>My ransomed soul shall be,<br>Through all eternity<br>Something for Thee.<br><br><br>
