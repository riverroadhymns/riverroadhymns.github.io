Was it for me, for me alone,<br>The Saviour left His glorious throne,<br>The dazzling splendours of the sky,<br>Was it for me He came to die?<br><br>Chorus<br>It was for me, yes, all for me;<br>O, love of God so great, so free;<br>O, wondrous love, I'll shout and sing,<br>He died for me, my Lord, the King.<br><br>Was it for me sweet angel strains<br>Came floating o'er Judea's plains,<br>That starlight night so long ago?<br>Was it for me God planned it so?<br><br>Chorus<br>It was for me, yes, all for me;<br>O, love of God so great, so free;<br>O, wondrous love, I'll shout and sing,<br>He died for me, my Lord, the King.<br><br>Was it for me He wept and prayed,<br>When prostrate in the garden laid,<br>That night within Gethsemane?<br>Was it for me, that agony?<br><br>Chorus<br>It was for me, yes, all for me;<br>O, love of God so great, so free;<br>O, wondrous love, I'll shout and sing,<br>He died for me, my Lord, the King.<br><br>Was it for me He bowed His head<br>Upon the cross, and freely shed<br>His precious blood - that crimson tide?<br>Was it for me the Saviour died?<br><br>Chorus<br>It was for me, yes, all for me;<br>O, love of God so great, so free;<br>O, wondrous love, I'll shout and sing,<br>He died for me, my Lord, the King.<br><br><br>
