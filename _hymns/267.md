O worship the King all-glorious above,<br>O gratefully sing His power and His love;<br>Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,<br>Pavilioned in splendour and girded with praise.<br><br>O tell of His might, O sing of His grace,<br>Whose robe is the light, whose canopy space;<br>His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form<br>And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.<br><br>The earth, with its store of wonders untold,<br>Almighty, Thy power hath founded of old;<br>Hath 'stablished it fast by a changeless decree,<br>And round it hath cast, like a mantle, the sea.<br><br>Thy bountiful care what tongue can recite?<br>It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;<br>It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,<br>And sweetly distils in the dew and the rain.<br><br>Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,<br>In Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail;<br>Thy mercies how tender, how firm to the end!<br>Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend.<br><br><br>
