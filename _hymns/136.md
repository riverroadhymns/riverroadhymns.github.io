Once again the Gospel message<br>From the Saviour you have heard;<br>Will you heed the invitation?<br>Will you turn unto the Lord?<br><br>Come believing! Come believing!<br>Come to Jesus! Look and live!<br>Come believing! Come believing!<br>Come to Jesus! Look and live!<br><br>Many summers you have wasted,<br>Ripened harvests you have seen,<br>Winter snows by spring have melted<br>Yet you linger in your sin!<br><br>Jesus for your choice is waiting;<br>Tarry not, at once decide.<br>While the Spirit now is striving,<br>Yield and seek the Saviour's side.<br><br>Cease of fitness to be thinking;<br>Do not longer try to feel;<br>It is trusting, and not feeling,<br>That will give the Spirit's seal.<br><br>Let your will to God be given,<br>Trust in Christ's atoning blood;<br>Look to Jesus now in heaven,<br>Rest on God's unchanging Word.<br><br><br>
