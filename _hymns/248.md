Down from His glory, ever-living story,<br>My God and Saviour came, and Jesus was His name;<br>Born in a manger, to His own a stranger,<br>A man of sorrows, tears and agony!<br><br>Chorus<br>O how I love Him! How I adore Him!<br>My breath, my sunshine, my all-in-all,<br>The great Creator became my Saviour;<br>And all God's fullness dwelleth in Him!<br><br>What condescension, bringing us redemption,<br>That in the dead of night, not one faint hope in sight;<br>God gracious, tender, laid aside His splendour,<br>Stooping to woo, to win, to save my soul.<br><br>Chorus<br>O how I love Him! How I adore Him!<br>My breath, my sunshine, my all-in-all,<br>The great Creator became my Saviour;<br>And all God's fullness dwelleth in Him!<br><br>Without reluctance, flesh and blood His substance,<br>He took the form of man, revealed the hidden plan;<br>O glorious mystery, sacrifice of Calvary<br>And now I know He is the great "I AM"!<br><br>Chorus<br>O how I love Him! How I adore Him!<br>My breath, my sunshine, my all-in-all,<br>The great Creator became my Saviour;<br>And all God's fullness dwelleth in Him!<br><br><br>
