"Come, let us reason," saith the Lord:<br>Your sins of crimson dye<br>Shall be like wool, or white as snow,<br>When you on Christ rely.<br><br>Chorus<br>Only trust Him! Only trust Him!<br>Only trust Him now!<br>He will save you! He will save you!<br>He will save you now!<br><br>"Come, heavy-laden, toiling - all!"<br>The loving Saviour cried,<br>O! He will give the weary rest:<br>For such alone He died.<br><br>Chorus<br>Only trust Him! Only trust Him!<br>Only trust Him now!<br>He will save you! He will save you!<br>He will save you now!<br><br>Come, thirsty ones, who oft have drained<br>The cup of pleasure dry,<br>For Jesus only life can give,<br>A life that ne'er shall die.<br><br>Chorus<br>Only trust Him! Only trust Him!<br>Only trust Him now!<br>He will save you! He will save you!<br>He will save you now!<br><br>Come as thou art, with all thy sins;<br>Come with thy hardened heart;<br>Come with thy cares, thy doubts, thy fears,<br>All grace He will impart.<br><br>Chorus<br>Only trust Him! Only trust Him!<br>Only trust Him now!<br>He will save you! He will save you!<br>He will save you now!<br><br>Come, now, while yet His mercy lasts,<br>Perhaps thou wilt not see<br>Tomorrow's sun; thy soul tonight<br>May be required of thee!<br><br>Chorus<br>Only trust Him! Only trust Him!<br>Only trust Him now!<br>He will save you! He will save you!<br>He will save you now!<br><br><br>
