I stand amazed in the presence<br>Of Jesus the Nazarene,<br>And wonder how He could love me,<br>A sinner, condemned, unclean.<br><br>Chorus<br>How marvellous! how wonderful!<br>And my song shall ever be:<br>How marvellous! how wonderful!<br>Is my Saviour's love for me.<br><br>For me it was in the garden<br>He prayed, "Not My will but Thine,"<br>He had no tears for His own griefs,<br>But sweat drops of blood for mine.<br><br>Chorus<br>How marvellous! how wonderful!<br>And my song shall ever be:<br>How marvellous! how wonderful!<br>Is my Saviour's love for me.<br><br>In wonder angels beheld Him<br>And came from the world of light<br>To comfort Him in the sorrows<br>He bore for my soul that night.<br><br>Chorus<br>How marvellous! how wonderful!<br>And my song shall ever be:<br>How marvellous! how wonderful!<br>Is my Saviour's love for me.<br><br>He took my sins and my sorrows,<br>He made them His very own;<br>He bore the burden on Calvary,<br>And suffered and died alone.<br><br>Chorus<br>How marvellous! how wonderful!<br>And my song shall ever be:<br>How marvellous! how wonderful!<br>Is my Saviour's love for me.<br><br>And when, with the ransomed in glory,<br>His face I at last shall see,<br>Twill be my joy through the ages<br>To sing of His love for me.<br><br><br>
