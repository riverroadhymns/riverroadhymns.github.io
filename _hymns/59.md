I am not skilled to understand,<br>What God hath willed, what God hath planned;<br>I only know at His right hand<br>Stands One who is my Saviour!<br><br>I take Him at His word indeed:<br>"Christ died for sinners," this I read;<br>For in my heart I find a need<br>Of Him to be my Saviour!<br><br>That He should leave His place on high,<br>And come for sinful man to die,<br>You count it strange - so once did I,<br>Before I knew my Saviour.<br><br>And O, that He fulfilled may see<br>The travail of His soul in me,<br>And with His work contented be,<br>As I with my dear Saviour!<br><br>Yea, living, dying, let me bring<br>My strength, my solace from this spring,<br>That He who lives to be my King<br>Once died to be my Saviour.<br><br><br>
