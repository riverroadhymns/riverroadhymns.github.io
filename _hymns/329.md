O Christ, Thou heavenly Lamb,<br>Joy of the Father's heart<br>Now let Thy love my soul inflame,<br>Fresh power to me impart!<br><br>Power to know the loss<br>Suffered, dear Lord, by Thee;<br>Power to glory in the cross<br>Thou didst endure for me.<br><br>Power to feel Thy love<br>And all its depths to know,<br>Power to fix the heart above,<br>And die to all below.<br><br>Power to keep the eye<br>For ever fixed on Thee;<br>Power to lift the warning cry<br>To souls from wrath to flee.<br><br>Power lost souls to win<br>From Satan's mighty hold;<br>Power the wanderers to bring<br>Back to the heavenly fold.<br><br>Power to watch and pray,<br>Lord Jesus, quickly come!<br>Power to hail the happy day,<br>Destined to bear me home!<br><br>Lord Jesus, then to me<br>Power divine impart,<br>To swell redemptions song to Thee,<br>For worthy, Lord, Thou art.<br><br><br>
