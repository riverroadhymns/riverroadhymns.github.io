When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound<br>And time shall be no more,<br>And the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair;<br>When the saved of earth shall gather<br>Over on the other shore,<br>And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.<br><br>Chorus<br>When the roll is called up yonder;<br>When the roll is called up yonder;<br>When the roll is called up yonder;<br>When the roll is called up yonder<br>I'll be there.<br><br>On that bright and cloudless morning<br>When the dead in Christ shall rise,<br>And the glory of His resurrection share;<br>When His chosen ones will gather<br>To their home beyond the skies,<br>And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.<br><br>Chorus<br>When the roll is called up yonder;<br>When the roll is called up yonder;<br>When the roll is called up yonder;<br>When the roll is called up yonder<br>I'll be there.<br><br>Let us labour for the Master<br>From the dawn till setting sun,<br>Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care;<br>Then, when all of life is over<br>And our work on earth is done,<br>And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.<br><br>Chorus<br>When the roll is called up yonder;<br>When the roll is called up yonder;<br>When the roll is called up yonder;<br>When the roll is called up yonder<br>I'll be there.<br><br><br>
