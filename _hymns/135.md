On the happy golden shore,<br>Where the faithful part no more,<br>When the storms of life are o'er,<br>Meet me there;<br>Where the night dissolves away,<br>Into pure and perfect day,<br>I am going home to stay.<br>Meet me there.<br><br>Chorus<br>Meet me there, meet me there,<br>Where the tree of life is blooming,<br>Meet me there;<br>When the storms of life are o'er;<br>On the happy golden shore,<br>Where the faithful part no more,<br>Meet me there.<br><br>Here our fondest hopes are vain,<br>Dearest links are rent in twain,<br>But in heaven no throb of pain,<br>Meet me there;<br>By the river sparkling bright,<br>In the city of delight,<br>Where our faith is lost in sight,<br>Meet me there.<br><br>Chorus<br>Meet me there, meet me there,<br>Where the tree of life is blooming,<br>Meet me there;<br>When the storms of life are o'er;<br>On the happy golden shore,<br>Where the faithful part no more,<br>Meet me there.<br><br>Where the harps of angels ring,<br>And the blest for ever sing,<br>In the palace of the King,<br>Meet me there;<br>Where in sweet communion blend,<br>Heart with heart, and friend with friend,<br>In a world that ne'er shall end,<br>Meet me there.<br><br>Chorus<br>Meet me there, meet me there,<br>Where the tree of life is blooming,<br>Meet me there;<br>When the storms of life are o'er;<br>On the happy golden shore,<br>Where the faithful part no more,<br>Meet me there.<br><br><br>
