Come ye that love the Lord and let your joys be known;<br>Join in a song with sweet accord,<br>And thus surround the throne.<br><br>Chorus<br>We're marching to Zion,<br>Beautiful, beautiful Zion;<br>We're marching upward to Zion,<br>The beautiful city of God.<br><br>Let those refuse to sing who never knew our God,<br>But children of the heavenly King<br>Should spread His praise abroad.<br><br>Chorus<br>We're marching to Zion,<br>Beautiful, beautiful Zion;<br>We're marching upward to Zion,<br>The beautiful city of God.<br><br>The hill of Zion yields a thousand sacred sweets<br>Before we reach the heavenly fields<br>Or walk the golden streets.<br><br>Chorus<br>We're marching to Zion,<br>Beautiful, beautiful Zion;<br>We're marching upward to Zion,<br>The beautiful city of God.<br><br>There shall we see His face, and never, never sin;<br>There, from the rivers of His grace,<br>Drink endless pleasures in.<br><br>Chorus<br>We're marching to Zion,<br>Beautiful, beautiful Zion;<br>We're marching upward to Zion,<br>The beautiful city of God.<br><br>Then let our songs abound and every tear be dry,<br>We're marching through Immanuel's ground,<br>To fairer worlds on high.<br><br>Chorus<br>We're marching to Zion,<br>Beautiful, beautiful Zion;<br>We're marching upward to Zion,<br>The beautiful city of God.<br><br><br>
