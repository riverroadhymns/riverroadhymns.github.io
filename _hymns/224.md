When the harvest is past and the summer is gone<br>And sermons and prayers shall be o'er;<br>When the beams cease to break, on the blest Lord's day morn,<br>And Jesus invites thee no more:<br><br>Chorus<br>When the harvest is past,<br>And the summer is o'er;<br>With the wheat or the tares<br>When the judgment appears;<br>O, which shall it be evermore?<br><br>When the rich gales of mercy no longer shall blow,<br>The Gospel no message declare;<br>Sinner, how canst thou bear the deep wailings of woe?<br>How suffer the night of despair?<br><br>Chorus<br>When the harvest is past,<br>And the summer is o'er;<br>With the wheat or the tares<br>When the judgment appears;<br>O, which shall it be evermore?<br><br>When the holy have gone to the regions of peace,<br>To dwell in the mansions above;<br>When their harmony wakes in the fullness of bliss,<br>Their songs to the Saviour they love.<br><br>Chorus<br>When the harvest is past,<br>And the summer is o'er;<br>With the wheat or the tares<br>When the judgment appears;<br>O, which shall it be evermore?<br><br>Say, O sinner, that livest at rest and secure,<br>Who fearest no trouble to come;<br>Can thy spirit the swellings of sorrow endure<br>Or bear the impenitent's doom?<br><br>Chorus<br>When the harvest is past,<br>And the summer is o'er;<br>With the wheat or the tares<br>When the judgment appears;<br>O, which shall it be evermore?<br><br><br>
