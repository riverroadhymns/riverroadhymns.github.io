The wanderer no more will roam,<br>The lost one to the fold hath come,<br>The prodigal is welcomed home,<br>O Lamb of God, in Thee!<br><br>Though clad in rags, by sin defiled,<br>The Father hath embraced His child<br>And I am pardoned, reconciled,<br>O Lamb of God, in Thee!<br><br>It is the Father's joy to bless,<br>His love provides for me a dress,<br>A robe of spotless righteousness,<br>O Lamb of God, in Thee!<br><br>Now shall my famished soul be fed,<br>A feast of love for me is spread,<br>I feed upon the children's bread,<br>O Lamb of God, in Thee!<br><br>Yea, in the fullness of His grace,<br>He puts me in the children's place,<br>Where I may gaze upon His face,<br>O Lamb of God, in Thee!<br><br>I cannot half His love express,<br>Yet, Lord, with joy my lips confess,<br>This blessed portion I possess,<br>O Lamb of God, in Thee!<br><br>And when I in Thy likeness shine,<br>The glory and the praise be Thine,<br>That everlasting joy is mine,<br>O Lamb of God, in Thee!<br><br><br>
