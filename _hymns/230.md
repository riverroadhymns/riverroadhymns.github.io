Why do you wait, O sinner?<br>O why do you tarry so long?<br>The Saviour is waiting to give you<br>A place in His sanctified throng.<br><br>Chorus<br>Why not? Why not?<br>Why not come to Him now?<br>Why not? Why not?<br>Why not come to Him now?<br><br>What do you hope, O sinner,<br>To gain by a further delay?<br>There's no one to save you but Jesus,<br>There's no other way but His way.<br><br>Chorus<br>Why not? Why not?<br>Why not come to Him now?<br>Why not? Why not?<br>Why not come to Him now?<br><br>Do you not feel, O sinner,<br>The Spirit now striving within?<br>O, why not accept His salvation,<br>And throw off thy burden of sin?<br><br>Chorus<br>Why not? Why not?<br>Why not come to Him now?<br>Why not? Why not?<br>Why not come to Him now?<br><br>Why do you wait, O sinner?<br>The harvest is passing away;<br>The Saviour is longing to bless you;<br>There's danger and death in delay.<br><br>Chorus<br>Why not? Why not?<br>Why not come to Him now?<br>Why not? Why not?<br>Why not come to Him now?<br><br><br>
