My hope is built on nothing less,<br>Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;<br>I dare not trust the sweetest frame,<br>But wholly lean on Jesus' name.<br><br>Chorus<br>On Christ the solid rock I stand;<br>All other ground is sinking sand,<br>All other ground is sinking sand.<br><br>When darkness seems to veil His face,<br>I rest on His unchanging grace;<br>In every high and stormy gale,<br>My anchor holds within the veil.<br><br>Chorus<br>On Christ the solid rock I stand;<br>All other ground is sinking sand,<br>All other ground is sinking sand.<br><br>His oath, His covenant, and blood,<br>Support me in the 'whelming flood,<br>When all around my soul gives way,<br>He then is all my hope and stay.<br><br>Chorus<br>On Christ the solid rock I stand;<br>All other ground is sinking sand,<br>All other ground is sinking sand.<br><br>When He shall come with trumpet sound<br>I know I shall in Him be found,<br>Dressed in His righteousness alone,<br>Faultless to stand before His throne.<br><br>Chorus<br>On Christ the solid rock I stand;<br>All other ground is sinking sand,<br>All other ground is sinking sand.<br><br><br>
