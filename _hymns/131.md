On a hill far away<br>Stood an old rugged cross,<br>The emblem of suffering and shame;<br>And I love that old cross<br>Where the dearest and best<br>For a world of lost sinners was slain.<br><br>Chorus<br>So I'll cherish the old rugged cross<br>Till my trophies at last I lay down;<br>I will cling to the old rugged cross<br>And exchange it some day for a crown.<br><br>O, the old rugged cross,<br>So despised by the world,<br>Has a wondrous attraction for me;<br>For the dear Lamb of God<br>Left His glory above<br>To bear it to dark Calvary.<br><br>Chorus<br>So I'll cherish the old rugged cross<br>Till my trophies at last I lay down;<br>I will cling to the old rugged cross<br>And exchange it some day for a crown.<br><br>In the old rugged cross,<br>Stained with blood so divine,<br>A wondrous beauty I see;<br>For 'twas on that old cross<br>Jesus suffered and died<br>To pardon and sanctify me.<br><br>Chorus<br>So I'll cherish the old rugged cross<br>Till my trophies at last I lay down;<br>I will cling to the old rugged cross<br>And exchange it some day for a crown.<br><br>To the old rugged cross<br>I will ever be true,<br>Its shame and reproach gladly bear;<br>Then He'll call me some day<br>To my home far away,<br>Where His glory for ever I'll share.<br><br>Chorus<br>So I'll cherish the old rugged cross<br>Till my trophies at last I lay down;<br>I will cling to the old rugged cross<br>And exchange it some day for a crown.<br><br><br>
