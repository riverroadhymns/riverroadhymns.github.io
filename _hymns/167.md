Tell me the old, old story<br>Of unseen things above,<br>Of Jesus and His glory,<br>Of Jesus and His love:<br>Tell me the story simply,<br>As to a little child,<br>For I am weak and weary,<br>And helpless and defiled.<br><br>Chorus<br>Tell me the old, old story,<br>Tell me the old, old story,<br>Tell me the old, old story,<br>Of Jesus and His love.<br><br>Tell me the story slowly,<br>That I may take it in,<br>That wonderful redemption,<br>God's remedy for sin;<br>Tell me the story often,<br>For I forget so soon;<br>The early dew of morning<br>Has passed away at noon.<br><br>Chorus<br>Tell me the old, old story,<br>Tell me the old, old story,<br>Tell me the old, old story,<br>Of Jesus and His love.<br><br>Tell me the story softly,<br>With earnest tones and grave;<br>Remember! I'm the sinner<br>Whom Jesus came to save.<br>Tell me that story always,<br>If you would really be<br>In any time of trouble,<br>A comforter to me.<br><br>Chorus<br>Tell me the old, old story,<br>Tell me the old, old story,<br>Tell me the old, old story,<br>Of Jesus and His love.<br><br>Tell me the same old story<br>When you have cause to fear<br>That this world's empty glory<br>Is costing me too dear.<br>Yes, and when that world's glory<br>Is dawning on my soul,<br>Tell me the old, old story<br>"Christ Jesus makes thee whole."<br><br>Chorus<br>Tell me the old, old story,<br>Tell me the old, old story,<br>Tell me the old, old story,<br>Of Jesus and His love.<br><br><br>
