There's a land that is fairer than day,<br>And by faith we can see it afar,<br>For the Father waits over the way<br>To prepare us a dwelling-place there.<br><br>Chorus<br>In the sweet by and by<br>We shall meet on that beautiful shore.<br>In the sweet by and by<br>We shall meet on that beautiful shore.<br><br>We shall sing on that beautiful shore<br>The melodious song of the blest,<br>And our spirits shall sorrow no more,<br>Not a sigh for the blessing 0f rest.<br><br>Chorus<br>In the sweet by and by<br>We shall meet on that beautiful shore.<br>In the sweet by and by<br>We shall meet on that beautiful shore.<br><br>To our bountiful Father above<br>We will offer our tribute of praise,<br>For the glorious gift of His love<br>And the blessings that hallow our days.<br><br>Chorus<br>In the sweet by and by<br>We shall meet on that beautiful shore.<br>In the sweet by and by<br>We shall meet on that beautiful shore.<br><br><br>
