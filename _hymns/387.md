May the mind of Christ, my Saviour<br>Live in me from day to day,<br>By His love and power controlling<br>All I do and say.<br><br>May the Word of God dwell richly<br>In my heart from hour to hour,<br>So that all may see I triumph<br>Only through His power.<br><br>May the peace of God my Father<br>Rule my life in everything,<br>That I may be calm to comfort<br>Sick and sorrowing.<br><br>May the love of Jesus fill me<br>As the waters fill the sea;<br>Him exalting, self abasing,<br>This is victory.<br><br>May I run the race before me,<br>Strong and brave to face the foe,<br>Looking only unto Jesus<br>As I onward go.<br><br>May His beauty rest upon me<br>As I seek the lost to win,<br>And may they forget the channel,<br>Seeing only Him.<br><br><br>
