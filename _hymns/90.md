Jesus, my Saviour, to Bethlehem came,<br>Born in a manger to sorrow and shame;<br>O, it was wonderful - blest be His Name!<br>Seeking for me, for me!<br><br>Chorus<br>Seeking for me, for me!<br>Seeking for me, for me!<br>O, it was wonderful - blest be His name!<br>Seeking for me, for me!<br><br>Jesus, my Saviour, on Calvary's tree,<br>Paid the great debt, and my soul He set free;<br>O, it was wonderful - how could it be?<br>Dying for me, for me!<br><br>Chorus<br>Dying for me, for me!<br>Dying for me, for me!<br>O, it was wonderful - how could it be?<br>Dying for me, for me!<br><br>Jesus, my Saviour, the same as of old,<br>While I was wandering far from the fold,<br>Gently and long did He plead with my soul,<br>Calling for me, for me!<br><br>Chorus<br>Calling for me, for me!<br>Calling for me, for me!<br>Gently and long did He plead with my soul,<br>Calling for me, for me!<br><br>Jesus, my Saviour, shall come from on high,<br>Sweet is the promise as weary years fly;<br>O, I shall see Him descending the sky,<br>Coming for me, for me!<br><br>Chorus<br>Coming for me, for me!<br>Coming for me, for me!<br>O, I shall see Him descending the sky,<br>Coming for me, for me!<br><br><br>
