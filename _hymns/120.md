O, teach me what it meaneth,<br>That cross uplifted high,<br>With One - the Man of Sorrows,<br>Condemned to bleed and die!<br>O, teach me what it cost Thee<br>To make a sinner whole;<br>And teach me, Saviour, teach me<br>The value of a soul!<br><br>O, teach me what it meaneth,<br>That sacred crimson tide,<br>The blood and water flowing<br>From Thine own wounded side.<br>Teach me that if none other<br>Had sinned, but I alone,<br>Yet still, Thy blood, Lord Jesus,<br>Thine only, must atone.<br><br>O, teach me what it meaneth,<br>Thy love beyond compare,<br>The love that reacheth deeper<br>Than depths of self-despair!<br>Yea, teach me, till there gloweth<br>In this cold heart of mine,<br>Some feeble, pale reflection<br>Of that pure love of Thine.<br><br>O, teach me what it meaneth,<br>For I am full of sin;<br>And grace alone can reach me,<br>And love alone can win.<br>O, teach me, for I need Thee,<br>I have no hope beside,<br>The chief of all the sinners<br>For whom the Saviour died!<br><br>O infinite Redeemer!<br>I bring no other plea,<br>Because Thou dost invite me,<br>I cast myself on Thee.<br>Because Thou dost accept me,<br>I love and I adore;<br>Because. Thy love constraineth,<br>I'll praise Thee evermore!<br><br><br>
