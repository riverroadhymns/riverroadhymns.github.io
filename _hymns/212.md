Under the burden of guilt and care,<br>Many a spirit is grieving,<br>Who in the joy of the Lord might share,<br>Life everlasting receiving.<br><br>Chorus<br>Life! life! eternal life!<br>Jesus alone is the Giver!<br>Life! life! abundant life!<br>Glory to Jesus for ever!<br><br>Burdened one, why will you longer bear<br>Sorrows from which He releases?<br>Open your heart and rejoicing share,<br>Life more abundant in Jesus.<br><br>Chorus<br>Life! life! eternal life!<br>Jesus alone is the Giver!<br>Life! life! abundant life!<br>Glory to Jesus for ever!<br><br>Leaving the mountain, the streamlet grows,<br>Flooding the vale with a river;<br>So, from the hill of the cross, there flows<br>Life more abundant for ever.<br><br>Chorus<br>Life! life! eternal life!<br>Jesus alone is the Giver!<br>Life! life! abundant life!<br>Glory to Jesus for ever!<br><br>O, for the floods on the thirsty land!<br>O, for a mighty revival!<br>O, for a sanctified, fearless band,<br>Ready to hail its arrival.<br><br>Chorus<br>Life! life! eternal life!<br>Jesus alone is the Giver!<br>Life! life! abundant life!<br>Glory to Jesus for ever!<br><br><br>
