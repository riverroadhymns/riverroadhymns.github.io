From Greenland's icy mountains,<br>From India's coral strand,<br>Where Afric's sunny fountains<br>Roll down their golden sand;<br>From many an ancient river,<br>From many a palmy plain,<br>They call us to deliver<br>Their land from error's chain.<br><br>What though the spicy breezes<br>Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle,<br>Though every prospect pleases<br>And only man is vile;<br>In vain with lavish kindness<br>The gifts of God are strewn;<br>The heathen in his blindness<br>Bows down to wood and stone.<br><br>Can we whose souls are lighted<br>With wisdom from on high;<br>Can we, to men benighted,<br>The lamp of life deny?<br>Salvation! O salvation!<br>The joyful sound proclaim,<br>Till earth's remotest nation<br>Has heard the Saviour's name!<br><br>Waft, waft ye winds, His story,<br>And you, ye waters, roll<br>Till like a sea of glory,<br>It spreads from pole to pole;<br>Till o'er our ransomed nature<br>The Lamb for sinners slain,<br>Redeemer, King, Creator,<br>In bliss returns to reign!<br><br><br>
