The perfect righteousness of God<br>Is witnessed in the Saviour's blood;<br>'Tis in the cross of Christ we trace<br>His righteousness, His wondrous grace;<br><br>God could not pass the sinner by,<br>His sins demand that he must die;<br>But in the cross of Christ we see<br>How God can save yet righteous be.<br><br>The judgment fell on Jesus' head<br>By His shed blood sin's debt is paid;<br>God's justice will demand no more<br>And mercy can dispense her store.<br><br>The sinner who believes is free,<br>Can say, "The Saviour died for me;"<br>Can point to His atoning blood<br>And say, "This made my peace with God."<br><br>How wondrous the redemption plan<br>Designed by God for ruined man!<br>His blessed Son in death laid low,<br>That He might endless life bestow.<br><br><br>
