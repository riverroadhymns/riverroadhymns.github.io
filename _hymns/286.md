By faith in a glorified Christ on the throne,<br>We give up the joys of the world to its own;<br>As strangers and pilgrims we plainly declare,<br>Our home is up yonder, but will you be there?<br><br>We're watching for Jesus, who entered within<br>The holiest of all when He put away sin;<br>A place in the glory He's gone to prepare,<br>Where we shall be with Him; but will you be there?<br><br>We're waiting for Jesus; His promise is plain,<br>His word's sure and steadfast, He's coming again;<br>A numberless people will meet in the air,<br>The Lord who redeemed them, but will you be there?<br><br>In the home of our Father the banquet is spread,<br>There the naked are clothed and the hungry are fed;<br>The house is fast filling, there is yet room to spare;<br>Not a seat will be vacant but will you be there?<br><br><br>
