I have a Saviour - He's pleading in glory,<br>So precious though earthly enjoyments be few;<br>And now He is watching in tenderness o'er me;<br>But O, that my Saviour were your Saviour too!<br><br>Chorus<br>For you I am praying,<br>For you I am praying,<br>For you I am praying,<br>I'm praying for you.<br><br>I have a rest- and the earnest is given,<br>Though now for a time 'tis concealed from my view;<br>Tis life everlasting - 'tis Jesus - 'tis heaven;<br>And O, dearest friend, let me meet you there too.<br><br>Chorus<br>For you I am praying,<br>For you I am praying,<br>For you I am praying,<br>I'm praying for you.<br><br>I have a peace - and it's calm as a river,<br>A peace that the friends of the world never knew;<br>My Saviour alone is its author and giver;<br>But O, could I know it was given to you!<br><br>Chorus<br>For you I am praying,<br>For you I am praying,<br>For you I am praying,<br>I'm praying for you.<br><br><br>
