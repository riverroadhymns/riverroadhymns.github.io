When God of old the way of life<br>Would teach to all His own,<br>He placed them safe beyond the reach<br>Of death, by blood alone.<br><br>Chorus<br>It is His Word God's precious Word,<br>It stands forever true;<br>"When I the Lord shall see the blood<br>I will pass over you."<br><br>By Christ, the sinless Lamb of God,<br>The precious blood was shed,<br>When He fulfilled God's holy Word,<br>And suffered in our stead.<br><br>Chorus<br>It is His Word God's precious Word,<br>It stands forever true;<br>"When I the Lord shall see the blood<br>I will pass over you."<br><br>O soul, for thee salvation thus<br>By God is freely given;<br>The blood of Christ atones for sin<br>And makes us meet for heaven.<br><br>Chorus<br>It is His Word God's precious Word,<br>It stands forever true;<br>"When I the Lord shall see the blood<br>I will pass over you."<br><br>The wrath of God that was our due,<br>Upon the Lamb was laid;<br>And by the shedding of His blood<br>The debt for us was paid.<br><br>Chorus<br>It is His Word God's precious Word,<br>It stands forever true;<br>"When I the Lord shall see the blood<br>I will pass over you."<br><br><br>
