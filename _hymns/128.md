O wondrous grace! that found a plan<br>To rescue guilty, fallen man,<br>And ease him of his load;<br>And found a ransom in the Son,<br>To save the sinner, lost, undone.<br>And meet the claims of God!<br><br>O wondrous grace! There, there He made<br>An end of sin - the debt He paid,<br>To ransom and redeem;<br>Now God is free to save and bless,<br>Consistent with His righteousness,<br>The soul which looks to Him.<br><br>O wondrous grace! still soaring high!<br>To save! Ah, more - to glorify<br>And give the soul a place<br>In Him who bore the curse, the load,<br>The risen, blessed Saviour - God,<br><br>O wondrous, wondrous grace!<br>And O what folly to refuse<br>Such wondrous grace, such blessed news,<br>So pure, unasked-for love!<br>Accept it! it is freely given,<br>This wondrous, perfect grace of heaven,<br>And all its fullness prove!<br><br><br>
