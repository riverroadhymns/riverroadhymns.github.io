Nailed upon Golgotha's tree,<br>Faint and bleeding. Who is He<br>Hands and feet so rudely torn,<br>Wreathed with crown of twisted thorn.<br>Once He lived in heaven above,<br>Happy in His Father's love,<br>Son of God, 'tis He, 'tis He,<br>On the cross of Calvary.<br><br>Nailed upon Golgotha's tree,<br>Mocked and taunted, Who is He<br>Scorners tell Him to come down,<br>Claim His kingdom and His crown.<br>He it is Who came to bless,<br>Full of love and tenderness,<br>Son of Man, 'tis He, 'tis He,<br>On the cross of Calvary.<br><br>Nailed upon Golgotha's tree,<br>As a victim, Who is He<br>Bearing sin, but not His own,<br>Suffering agony unknown.<br>He, the promised sacrifice,<br>For the sinner bleeds and dies,<br>Lamb of God, 'tis He, 'tis He,<br>On the cross of Calvary.<br><br><br>
