I bow me to Thy will, O God!<br>And all Thy ways adore,<br>And every day I live, I'd seek<br>To please Thee more and more.<br><br>Why should I care, O blessed Lord!<br>Since all my cares are Thine;<br>Why not in triumph live, since Thou<br>Hast made Thy triumphs mine.<br><br>Lead on, lead on triumphantly,<br>O blessed Lord, lead on:<br>Faith's pilgrim sons behind Thee seek<br>The road that Thou hast gone.<br><br>He always wins who sides with God,<br>To him no chance is lost;<br>God's will is sweetest to him when<br>It triumphs at his cost.<br><br>Ill that God blesses is our good,<br>And unblessed good is ill,<br>And all is right that seems most wrong,<br>If it be His sweet will.<br><br><br>
