"Yet there is room!" The Lamb's bright hall of song,<br>With its fair glory, beckons thee along:<br>Room, room, still room, O, enter, enter now.<br><br>Day is declining, and the sun is low:<br>The shadows lengthen, light makes haste to go,<br>Room, room, still room, O, enter, enter now.<br><br>The bridal hall is tilling for the feast;<br>Pass in, pass in, and be the Bridegroom's guest,<br>Room, room, still room, O, enter, enter now.<br><br>Louder and sweeter sounds the loving call:<br>"Come, lingerer, come," enter that festal hall,<br>Room, room, still room, O, enter, enter now.<br><br>Ere night that gate may close and seal thy doom,<br>Then the last low, long cry, "No room, no room."<br>No room, no room, O, woeful cry, "No room."<br><br><br>
