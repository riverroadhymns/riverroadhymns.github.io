Are you weary and sad 'neath the burden of sin<br>Does it fill all your soul with dismay<br>And to meet the just claims of a sin-hating God<br>Do you know you have nothing to pay<br><br>Chorus<br>Come! Come, come unto Him!<br>If you own with repentance you've nothing to pay,<br>He will freely and frankly forgive,<br><br>All your tears and your sorrow will never atone,<br>Nor by works can you clear away sin,<br>Then turn to the One who can save you alone,<br>To the Saviour in confidence cling.<br><br>Chorus<br>Come! Come, come unto Him!<br>If you own with repentance you've nothing to pay,<br>He will freely and frankly forgive,<br><br>He's the One who has come from God's glory above,<br>To save you from ruin and loss;<br>For He paid the full debt in His own precious blood<br>When He put away sin on the cross.<br><br>Chorus<br>Come! Come, come unto Him!<br>If you own with repentance you've nothing to pay,<br>He will freely and frankly forgive,<br><br>Then come, ruined sinner, no longer delay,<br>Nor in bondage and misery live;<br>lf you own with repentance, you've nothing to pay,<br>He will freely and frankly forgive.<br><br>Chorus<br>Come! Come, come unto Him!<br>If you own with repentance you've nothing to pay,<br>He will freely and frankly forgive,<br><br><br>
