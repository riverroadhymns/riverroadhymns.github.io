All hail the power of Jesus' Name!<br>Let angels prostrate fall!<br>Bring forth the royal diadem,<br>And crown Him Lord of all!<br><br>Crown Him, ye martyrs of our God<br>Who from His altar call;<br>Extol the stem of Jesse's rod<br>And crown Him Lord of all!<br><br>Ye chosen seed of Israel's race,<br>A remnant weak and small,<br>Hail Him who saves you by His grace<br>And crown Him Lord of all!<br><br>Sinners, whose love can ne'er forget<br>The wormwood and the gall,<br>Go, spread your trophies at His feet,<br>And crown Him Lord of all!<br><br>Let every kindred, every tribe,<br>On this terrestrial ball,<br>To Him all majesty ascribe,<br>And crown Him Lord of all!<br><br>O that, with yonder sacred throng,<br>We at His feet may fall;<br>Join in the everlasting song<br>And crown Him Lord of all.<br><br><br>
