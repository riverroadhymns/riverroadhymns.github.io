Lord Jesus, Thou who only art<br>The endless source of purest joy,<br>O! come and till this longing heart,<br>May nought but Thee my thoughts employ.<br>Teach me on Thee to fix my eye,<br>For none but Thee can satisfy.<br><br>The joys of earth can never fill<br>The heart that's tasted of Thy love;<br>No portion will I seek until<br>I reign with Thee, my Lord, above.<br>When I shall gaze upon Thy face,<br>And know more fully all Thy grace.<br><br>When from Thy radiant throne on high<br>Thou didst my fall and ruin see,<br>Thou cam'st on earth for me, to die<br>That I might share Thy throne with Thee.<br>Loved with an everlasting love,<br>My hopes, my joys are all above.<br><br>O, what is all that earth can give?<br>I'm called to share in God's own joy;<br>Dead to the world, in Thee I live,<br>In Thee I've bliss without alloy:<br>Well may I earthly joys resign,<br>All things are mine and I am Thine.<br><br>Till Thou shalt come to take me home,<br>Be this my one ambition, Lord,<br>Self, sin, the world to overcome,<br>Fast clinging to Thy faithful word,<br>More of Thyself each day to know<br>And more into Thine image grow.<br><br><br>
