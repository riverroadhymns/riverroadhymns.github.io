When the Saviour said, "'Tis finished,"<br>Everything was fully done,<br>Done as God Himself would have it,<br>Christ the victory fully won.<br>Vain and futile the endeavour<br>To improve or add thereto;<br>God's free grace is thus commended<br>To "believe" and not "to do."<br><br>All the doing is completed,<br>Now 'tis look, believe, and live;<br>None can purchase his salvation,<br>Life's a gift that God does give;<br>Grace through righteousness is reigning,<br>Not of works lest man should boast;<br>Man must take the mercy freely,<br>Or eternally be lost.<br><br><br>
