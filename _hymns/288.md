Christ, the Lord is risen today, Alleluia!<br>Sons of men and angels say. Alleluia!<br>Raise your joys and triumphs high, Alleluia!<br>Sing, ye heavens and earth reply: Alleluia!<br><br>Love's redeeming work is done; Alleluia!<br>Fought the fight, the battle won, Alleluia!<br>Vain the stone, the watch, the seal, Alleluia!<br>Christ has burst the gates of hell, Alleluia!<br><br>Lives again our glorious King! Alleluia!<br>Where, O death, is now thy sting? Alleluia!<br>Once He died, our souls to save, Alleluia!<br>Where's thy victory, O grave? Alleluia!<br><br>Soar we now where Christ has led, Alleluia!<br>Following our exalted Head, Alleluia!<br>Made like Him, like Him we rise, Alleluia!<br>Ours the cross, the grave, the skies. Alleluia!<br><br>Hail, the Lord of earth and heaven! Alleluia!<br>Praise to Thee by all be given! Alleluia!<br>Thee we greet triumphant now, Alleluia!<br>Hail, the Resurrection Thou! Alleluia!<br><br><br>
