By cool Siloam's shady rill<br>How fair the lily grows!<br>How sweet the breath, beneath the hill<br>Of Sharon's dewy rose!<br><br>Lo! such the child whose early feet<br>The paths of peace have trod,<br>Whose secret heart, with influence sweet,<br>Is upward drawn to God.<br><br>By cool Siloam's shady rill,<br>The lily must decay;<br>The rose that blooms beneath the hill<br>Must shortly fade away.<br><br>And soon, too soon, the wintry hour<br>Of man's maturer age<br>Will shake the soul with sorrow's power<br>And stormy passion's rage.<br><br>O Thou Whose infant feet were found<br>Within Thy Father's shrine,<br>Whose years with changeless virtue crowned,<br>Were all alike divine.<br><br>Dependent on Thy bounteous breath,<br>We seek Thy grace alone,<br>In childhood, manhood age, and death<br>To keep us still Thine own.<br><br><br>
