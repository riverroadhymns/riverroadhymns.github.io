Tis the voice of Jehovah commands thee, awake!<br>For time is fast passing, thy soul is at stake;<br>Eternity's darkness and gloom draweth nigh;<br>Then awake, ere ye perish - for why will ye die?<br><br>Awake, careless sinner, God bids thee awake!<br>Why rush madly on to the fierce burning lake<br>Tis folly to trifle the moments away;<br>Then awake! O awake and be saved while ye may.<br><br>Awake, false professor, O think not thy form<br>Will shield thee from wrath in that pitiless storm;<br>When the judgment of God as great billows shall roll<br>In dire destruction o'er each Christless soul.<br><br>And thou, poor deceived one, arouse thee, awake!<br>Be warned of thy danger, O learn thy mistake;<br>Thy life may seem righteous, thy works suit thee well,<br>But 'tis Jesus alone who can save thee from hell.<br><br>Ye anxious ones, listen, O hark to God's Word<br>Proclaiming salvation through Jesus the Lord;<br>His precious blood, shed on the cross long ago,<br>Can save thee from sin and deliver from woe.<br><br><br>
