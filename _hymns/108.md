O come, sinner, come,<br>O, why do you delay<br>The pressing invitation is<br>That you should come today.<br>Tomorrow has no promise<br>That it can give to you.<br>Tomorrow is eternity<br>Just hidden from your view.<br><br>Chorus<br>Then come, sinner, come,<br>Salvation's free for all,<br>It may be the last time<br>You'll ever hear the call.<br><br>O come, sinner, come,<br>The bride, the Spirit, call,<br>Thus saying now to you and me<br>That Jesus died for all.<br>O grieve not then the Spirit,<br>Accept Him while you can;<br>For God has said, "My Spirit shall<br>Not always strive with man."<br><br>Chorus<br>Then come, sinner, come,<br>Salvation's free for all,<br>It may be the last time<br>You'll ever hear the call.<br><br><br>O come, sinner, come,<br>Accept the offered grace,<br>For death may soon be calling you<br>Into its cold embrace.<br>The summer will be ended,<br>The harvest will be past,<br>Your lamentation then will be<br>"My soul is lost at last."<br><br>Chorus<br>Then come, sinner, come,<br>Salvation's free for all,<br>It may be the last time<br>You'll ever hear the call.<br><br><br>
