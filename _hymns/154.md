She only touched the hem of His garment<br>As to His side she stole,<br>Amid the crowd that gathered around him,<br>And straightway she was whole.<br><br>Chorus<br>O touch the hem of His garment<br>And thou, too, shalt be free!<br>His saving power; this very hour,<br>Shall give new life to thee.<br><br>She came in fear. and trembling before Him,<br>She knew her Lord had come;<br>She felt that from Him virtue had healed her,<br>The mighty deed was done.<br><br>Chorus<br>O touch the hem of His garment<br>And thou, too, shalt be free!<br>His saving power; this very hour,<br>Shall give new life to thee.<br><br><br>
