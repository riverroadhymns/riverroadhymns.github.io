Again the blessed Gospel I have heard,<br>That Word divine and true,<br>And God again has spoken to my soul;<br>O now, what shall I do<br><br>Chorus<br>I come, I come,<br>I come to Thee, My God,<br>I do Thy love believe,<br>I do accept Thy gift of life and peace,<br>I do Thy Son receive.<br><br>My wayward heart has wandered far from Thee<br>And known no rest or home,<br>No present peace, no hope of joy beyond,<br>But now to Thee I come.<br><br>Chorus<br>I come, I come,<br>I come to Thee, My God,<br>I do Thy love believe,<br>I do accept Thy gift of life and peace,<br>I do Thy Son receive.<br><br>No works of mine, no merit can I bring,<br>No holiness within,<br>I only trust the precious blood of Christ;<br>It cleanses from all sin.<br><br>Chorus<br>I come, I come,<br>I come to Thee, My God,<br>I do Thy love believe,<br>I do accept Thy gift of life and peace,<br>I do Thy Son receive.<br><br><br>
