Jesus, lover of my soul,<br>Let me to Thy bosom fly,<br>While the nearer waters roll,<br>While the tempest still is high;<br>Hide me, O my Saviour, hide,<br>Till the storm of life is past!<br>Safe into the haven guide,<br>O, receive my soul at last.<br><br>Other refuge have I none,<br>Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;<br>Leave, O leave me not alone,<br>Still support and comfort me;<br>All my trust on Thee is stayed,<br>All my help from Thee I bring;<br>Cover my defenseless head<br>With the shadow of Thy wing.<br><br>Plenteous grace with Thee is found,<br>Grace to cover all my sin;<br>Let the healing streams abound;<br>Make me, keep me pure within.<br>Thou of life the fountain art,<br>Freely let me take of Thee;<br>Spring Thou up within my heart,<br>Now and to eternity.<br><br><br>
