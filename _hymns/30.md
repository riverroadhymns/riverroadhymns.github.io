Come tell abroad a Saviour's love<br>In sacred melody,<br>In love He came from heaven above,<br>He went to Calvary.<br><br>Chorus<br>We now proclaim His saving Name,<br>On Christ alone depend,<br>And you shall know e'en here below,<br>A life that ne'er shall end.<br><br>He saw us lost and doomed to die,<br>And when all hope had fled,<br>He came the law to magnify,<br>By dying in our stead.<br><br>Chorus<br>We now proclaim His saving Name,<br>On Christ alone depend,<br>And you shall know e'en here below,<br>A life that ne'er shall end.<br><br>Our sins had filled a bitter cup,<br>Which we could never drain,<br>In love the Saviour drank it up,<br>He died, He lives again.<br><br>Chorus<br>We now proclaim His saving Name,<br>On Christ alone depend,<br>And you shall know e'en here below,<br>A life that ne'er shall end.<br><br>Glad tidings now to all we bring,<br>Tis God's good news we tell;<br>Come trust the Saviour while we sing,<br>He saves from death and hell.<br><br>Chorus<br>We now proclaim His saving Name,<br>On Christ alone depend,<br>And you shall know e'en here below,<br>A life that ne'er shall end.<br><br><br>
