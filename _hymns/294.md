He giveth more grace when the burdens grow greater;<br>He sendeth more strength when the labours increase.<br>To added affliction He addeth His mercy,<br>To multiplied trials His multiplied peace.<br><br>Chorus<br>His love has no limit, His grace has no measure,<br>His power no boundary known unto men,<br>For out of His infinite riches in Jesus,<br>He giveth and giveth and giveth again.<br><br>When we have exhausted our store of endurance,<br>When strength has declined ere the day is half done,<br>When we reach the end of our hoarded resources,<br>Our Father's full giving is only begun.<br><br>Chorus<br>His love has no limit, His grace has no measure,<br>His power no boundary known unto men,<br>For out of His infinite riches in Jesus,<br>He giveth and giveth and giveth again.<br><br><br>
