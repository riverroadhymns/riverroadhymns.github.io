Brightly beams our Father's mercy<br>From His lighthouse evermore;<br>But to us He gives the keeping<br>Of the lights along the shore.<br><br>Chorus<br>Let the lower lights be burning,<br>Send a gleam across the wave!<br>Some poor fainting, struggling seaman,<br>You may rescue, you may save.<br><br>Dark the night of sin has settled<br>Loud the angry billows roar;<br>Eager eyes are watching, longing,<br>For the lights along the shore.<br><br>Chorus<br>Let the lower lights be burning,<br>Send a gleam across the wave!<br>Some poor fainting, struggling seaman,<br>You may rescue, you may save.<br><br>Trim your feeble lamp, my brother<br>Some poor seaman, tempest-tossed,<br>Trying now to make the harbour,<br>In the darkness may be lost.<br><br>Chorus<br>Let the lower lights be burning,<br>Send a gleam across the wave!<br>Some poor fainting, struggling seaman,<br>You may rescue, you may save.<br><br>With the Saviour as your pilot,<br>You have conquered wind and wave;<br>Let His brightness shining through you,<br>Be a beacon light to save.<br><br>Chorus<br>Let the lower lights be burning,<br>Send a gleam across the wave!<br>Some poor fainting, struggling seaman,<br>You may rescue, you may save.<br><br><br>
