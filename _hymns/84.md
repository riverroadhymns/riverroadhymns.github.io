It was alone the Saviour prayed<br>In dark Gethsemane;<br>Alone He drained the bitter cup,<br>And suffered on the tree.<br><br>Chorus<br>Alone, alone, He bore it all alone,<br>He gave Himself to save His own;<br>He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.<br><br>It was alone the Saviour stood<br>In Pilate's judgment hall;<br>Alone the crown of thorns He bore,<br>Forsaken there by all.<br><br>Chorus<br>Alone, alone, He bore it all alone,<br>He gave Himself to save His own;<br>He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.<br><br>Alone upon the Cross He hung<br>That others He might save;<br>Forsaken then by God Himself,<br>Alone His life He gave.<br><br>Chorus<br>Alone, alone, He bore it all alone,<br>He gave Himself to save His own;<br>He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.<br><br>Can you reject such matchless love?<br>Can you His claim disown?<br>Commit your soul in faith to Him<br>Who bore your guilt alone.<br><br>Chorus<br>Alone, alone, He bore it all alone,<br>He gave Himself to save His own;<br>He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.<br><br><br>
