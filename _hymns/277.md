A mind at perfect peace with God,<br>O! what a word is this!<br>A sinner reconciled through blood,<br>This, this indeed is peace!<br><br>By nature and by practice far,<br>How very far from God!<br>Yet now by grace brought nigh to Him<br>Through faith in Jesus' blood.<br><br>So near, so very near to God,<br>I cannot nearer be;<br>For in the person of His Son<br>I am as near as He.<br><br>So dear, so very dear to God,<br>More dear I cannot be;<br>The love wherewith He loves the Son,<br>Such is His love to me!<br><br>Why should I ever careful be,<br>Since such a God is mine?<br>He watches o'er me night and day,<br>And tells me "Mine is thine."<br><br><br>
