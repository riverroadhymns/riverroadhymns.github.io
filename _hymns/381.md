Hark! 'tis the watchman's cry,<br>Wake, brethren, wake!<br>Jesus, our Lord is nigh,<br>Wake, brethren, wake!<br>Sleep is for sons of night,<br>Ye are children of the light,<br>Yours is the glory bright!<br>Wake, brethren, wake!<br><br>Call to each waking band,<br>Watch, brethren, watch!<br>Clear is our Lord's command,<br>Watch, brethren, watch!<br>Be ye as men that wait<br>Always at the Master's gate,<br>E'en though the hour seem late!<br>Watch, brethren, watch!<br><br>Hear we the Shepherd's voice,<br>Pray, brethren, pray!<br>Would ye His heart rejoice?<br>Pray, brethren, pray!<br>Sin calls for constant fear,<br>Weakness needs the strong One near,<br>Long as ye struggle here!<br>Pray, brethren, pray!<br><br>Heed we the steward's call,<br>Work, brethren, work!<br>There's room enough for all!<br>Work, brethren, work!<br>This vineyard of the Lord<br>Constant labour doth afford,<br>Yours is a sure reward!<br>Work, brethren, work!<br><br>Now sound the final chord,<br>Praise, brethren, praise!<br>Thrice holy is our Lord,<br>Praise, brethren, praise!<br>What more befits the tongues<br>Soon to lead the eternal songs,<br>While heaven the note prolongs,<br>Praise, brethren, praise!<br><br><br>
