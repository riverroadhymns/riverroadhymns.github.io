Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?<br>Is not thine a captured heart?<br>Chief among ten thousand own Him,<br>Joyful choose the better part.<br><br>Idols once they won thee, charmed thee,<br>Lovely things of time and sense;<br>Gilded, thus does sin disarm thee,<br>Honeyed lest thou turn thee hence.<br><br>What has stripped the seeming beauty<br>From the idols of the earth?<br>Not the sense of right or duty<br>But the sight of peerless worth.<br><br>Not the crushing of those idols<br>With its bitter void and smart,<br>But the beaming of His beauty,<br>The unveiling of His heart.<br><br>Who extinguishes their taper<br>Till they hail the rising sun?<br>Who discards the garb of winter<br>Till the summer has begun?<br><br>'Tis the look that melted Peter,<br>'Tis the face that Stephen saw,<br>'Tis the heart that wept with Mary,<br>Can alone from idols draw.<br><br>Draw, and win, and till completely,<br>Till the cup o'erflow the brim;<br>What have we to do with idols,<br>Who have companied with Him?<br><br><br>
