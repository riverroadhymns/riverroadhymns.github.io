Come, ye sinners, poor and needy,<br>Weak and wounded, sick and sore;<br>Jesus ready stands to save you,<br>Full of pity, love and power.<br><br>Come, ye thirsty, come, and welcome,<br>God's free bounty glorify;<br>True belief and true repentance,<br>Every grace that brings you nigh.<br><br>Let not conscience make you linger,<br>Nor of fitness fondly dream;<br>All the fitness He requireth,<br>Is to feel your need of Him.<br><br>Come ye weary, heavy laden,<br>Lost and ruined by the fall;<br>If you tarry till you're better,<br>You will never come at all.<br><br><br>
