Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim,<br>And publish abroad His wonderful name;<br>The name, all victorious, of Jesus extol;<br>His kingdom is glorious and rules over all.<br><br>God ruleth on high, almighty to save<br>And still He is nigh, His presence we have.<br>The great congregation His triumph shall sing,<br>Ascribing salvation to Jesus our King.<br><br>Salvation to God Who sits on the throne;<br>Let all cry aloud and honour the Son;<br>The praises of Jesus all angels proclaim;<br>Fall down on their faces and worship the Lamb.<br><br>Then let us adore and give Him His right;<br>All glory and power, all wisdom and might;<br>All honour and blessing, with angels above<br>And thanks never ceasing, and infinite love.<br><br><br>
