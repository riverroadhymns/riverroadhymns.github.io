The gospel of Thy grace,<br>My stubborn heart has won;<br>For God so loved the world,<br>He gave His only Son,<br>That "Whosoever will believe,<br>Shall everlasting life receive!"<br><br>The serpent "lifted up"<br>Could life and healing give,<br>So Jesus on the cross,<br>Bids me to look and live:<br>For "Whosoever will believe,<br>Shall everlasting life receive!"<br><br>"The soul that sinneth dies;"<br>My awful doom I heard;<br>I was forever lost<br>But for Thy gracious Word,<br>That "Whosoever will believe,<br>Shall everlasting life receive!"<br><br>"Not to condemn the world"<br>The "Man of Sorrows" came,<br>But that the world might have<br>Salvation through His name:<br>For "Whosoever will believe,<br>Shall everlasting life receive!"<br><br>"Lord, help my unbelief!"<br>Give me the peace of faith<br>To rest in child-like trust<br>On what the gospel saith,<br>That "Whosoever will believe,<br>Shall everlasting life receive!"<br><br><br>
