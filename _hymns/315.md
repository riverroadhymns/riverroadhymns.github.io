Lord Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine,<br>My Rock and my Fortress, my Surety divine;<br>My gracious Redeemer, my song shall be now<br>Tis Thou who art worthy, Lord Jesus, 'tis Thou.<br><br>I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me,<br>And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;<br>I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;<br>Tis Thou who art worthy, Lord Jesus, 'tis Thou.<br><br>I would love Thee in life, I would love Thee in death.<br>And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath,<br>And sing, should the death-dew lie cold on my brow,<br>Tis Thou who art worthy, Lord Jesus, 'tis Thou.<br><br>And when the bright morn of Thy glory shall come,<br>And the children ascend to the Father's glad home,<br>I'll shout, with Thy likeness impressed on my brow,<br>Tis Thou who art worthy, Lord Jesus, 'tis Thou.<br><br><br>
