Be still, my soul! The Lord is on thy side;<br>Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain;<br>Leave to thy God to order and provide,<br>In every change He faithful will remain.<br>Be still, my soul! Thy best, thy heavenly Friend<br>Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.<br><br>Be still, my soul! Thy God doth undertake<br>To guide the future as He has the past;<br>Thy hope, thy confidence, let nothing shake,<br>All now mysterious shall be bright at last.<br>Be still, my soul! The waves and winds still know<br>His voice who ruled them while He dwelt below.<br><br>Be still, my soul! When dearest friends depart,<br>And all is darkened in the vale of tears,<br>Then shalt thou better know His love, His heart,<br>Who comes to soothe thy sorrow and thy fears.<br>Be still, my soul! Thy Giver can repay,<br>From His own fullness, all He takes away.<br><br>Be still, my soul! The hour is hastening on<br>When we shall be forever with the Lord,<br>When disappointment, grief and fear are gone,<br>Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.<br>Be still, my soul! when change and tears are past,<br>All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.<br><br><br>
