What will you do on that great day<br>When heaven and earth shall pass away,<br>When all the pomp and glory here,<br>Like morning dew shall disappear,<br>And you, from out your lonely tomb,<br>Shall stand in judgment's awful doom?<br><br>When God's great trump shall wake the dead,<br>Where will you hide your once fair head<br>What will you do? where can you go,<br>Amid that fearful scene of woe,<br>Where none can help, and all alone<br>You stand before that great white throne?<br><br>What will you do when lightnings flash,<br>This wide world quivers, thunders crash?<br>The earth shall melt with fervent heat,<br>But you, O where can you retreat?<br>Not e'en the grave can hide you more,<br>For death and hell their dead restore.<br><br>O, awful day! who would not be<br>Sheltered, O Lamb of God, in Thee?<br>Safe at Thy side when wild and loud<br>The shrieks of that unnumbered crowd<br>Shall rend the heavens and fill the skies,<br>Till judgment's doom shall close their cries.<br><br><br>
