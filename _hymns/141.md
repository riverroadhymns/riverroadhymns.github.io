Out of Christ, without a Saviour,<br>O! can it, can it be<br>Like a ship without a rudder,<br>On a wild and stormy sea!<br><br>Chorus<br>O! to be without a Saviour;<br>With no hope or refuge nigh;<br>Can it be, O blessed Saviour<br>One without Thee dares to die!<br><br>Out of Christ, without a Saviour,<br>Lonely and dark the way;<br>With no light, no hope in Jesus,<br>Making bright the cheerless day.<br><br>Chorus<br>O! to be without a Saviour;<br>With no hope or refuge nigh;<br>Can it be, O blessed Saviour<br>One without Thee dares to die!<br><br>Out of Christ, without a Saviour,<br>No help nor refuge nigh;<br>How can you, O careless sinner,<br>Dare to live, or dare to die?<br><br>Chorus<br>O! to be without a Saviour;<br>With no hope or refuge nigh;<br>Can it be, O blessed Saviour<br>One without Thee dares to die!<br><br>Out of Christ, without a Saviour,<br>Dark will the voyage be;<br>Clouds will gather, storms surround you,<br>O! to Christ for refuge flee!<br><br>Chorus<br>O! to be without a Saviour;<br>With no hope or refuge nigh;<br>Can it be, O blessed Saviour<br>One without Thee dares to die!<br><br>Out of Christ, without a Saviour,<br>Trust Him with all thine heart,<br>Ere the door of mercy closes,<br>And you hear His word, "Depart."<br><br>Chorus<br>O! to be without a Saviour;<br>With no hope or refuge nigh;<br>Can it be, O blessed Saviour<br>One without Thee dares to die!<br><br><br>
