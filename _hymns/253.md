Great God of wonders! All Thy ways<br>Display Thine attributes divine;<br>But the bright glories of Thy grace<br>Above Thine other wonders shine:<br><br>Chorus<br>Who is a pardoning God like Thee?<br>Or who has grace so rich and free?<br><br>Such deep transgressions to forgive!<br>Such guilty, daring worms to spare!<br>This is Thy grand prerogative<br>And in this honour none shall share:<br><br>Chorus<br>Who is a pardoning God like Thee?<br>Or who has grace so rich and free?<br><br>Pardon from an offended God!<br>Pardon for sins of deepest dye!<br>Pardon bestowed through Jesus' blood!<br>Pardon that brings the rebel nigh!<br><br>Chorus<br>Who is a pardoning God like Thee?<br>Or who has grace so rich and free?<br><br><br>
