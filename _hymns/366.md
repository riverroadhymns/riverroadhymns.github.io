Is it Thy will that I should be<br>Buried in symbol, Lord, with Thee?<br>Owning Thee by this solemn sign,<br>Telling the world that I am Thine.<br><br>Gladly I yield obedience now;<br>In all things to Thy will I'd bow;<br>I'll follow where my Saviour led<br>And humbly in His footsteps tread.<br><br>This emblematic, watery grave<br>Shows forth His love, who came to save<br>And as I enter it, I see<br>The price my Saviour paid for me.<br><br>Forth from Thy burial, Lord, I come,<br>For Thou hast triumphed o'er the tomb;<br>Thy resurrection life I share,<br>My portion is no longer here.<br><br>O may I count myself to be<br>Dead to the sins that wounded Thee,<br>Dead to the pleasures of this earth,<br>Unworthy of my heavenly birth.<br><br>Lord Jesus, when I gaze on Thee<br>And all Thy radiant glory see,<br>That joy will far exceed the shame<br>I bear on earth for Thy loved Name.<br><br><br>
