My faith looks up to Thee,<br>Thou Lamb of Calvary,<br>Saviour divine;<br>Now hear me while I pray;<br>Take all my guilt away;<br>O, let me from this day<br>Be wholly Thine.<br><br>May Thy rich grace impart<br>Strength to my fainting heart,<br>My zeal inspire;<br>As Thou hast died for me,<br>O, may my love to Thee<br>Pure, warm, and changeless be,<br>A living fire.<br><br>While life's dark maze I tread,<br>And griefs around me spread,<br>Be Thou my guide,<br>Bid darkness turn to day,<br>Wipe sorrow's tears away;<br>Nor let me ever stray<br>From Thee aside,<br><br>When ends life's transient dream,<br>When death's cold sullen stream<br>Shall o'er me roll,<br>Blest Saviour, then in love,<br>Fear and distress remove;<br>O, bear me safe above,<br>A ransomed soul.<br><br><br>
