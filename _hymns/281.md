Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,<br>That saved a wretch like me!<br>I once was lost, but now am found;<br>Was blind, but now I see.<br><br>Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,<br>And grace my fears relieved;<br>How precious did that grace appear,<br>The hour I first believed!<br><br>Through many dangers, toils and snares,<br>I have already come;<br>Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far<br>And grace will lead me home.<br><br>When we've been there ten thousand years,<br>Bright shining as the sun,<br>We've no less days to sing God's praise<br>Than when we'd first begun.<br><br><br>
