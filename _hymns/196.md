There's a Stranger at the door; let Him in!<br>He has been there oft' before; let Him in!<br>Let Him in, ere He is gone;<br>Let Him in, the Holy One,<br>Jesus Christ, the Father's Son; Let Him in!<br><br>Open now to Him your heart; let Him in!<br>If you wait He will depart; let Him in!<br>Let Him in, He is your friend;<br>He your soul will sure defend;<br>He will keep you to the end; let Him in!<br><br>Now admit the heavenly Guest; let Him in!<br>He will make for you a feast; let Him in!<br>He will speak your sins forgiven;<br>And when earth-ties all are riven;<br>He will take you home to heaven; let Him in!<br><br><br>
