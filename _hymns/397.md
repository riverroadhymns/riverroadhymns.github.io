Speed Thy servants, Saviour speed them,<br>Thou art Lord of winds and waves;<br>They were bound, but Thou hast freed them,<br>Now they go to free the slaves;<br>Be Thou with them,<br>Tis Thine arm alone that saves.<br><br>Friends and homes and all forsaking,<br>Lord, they go at Thy command,<br>As their stay Thy promise taking,<br>While they traverse sea and land;<br>O, be with them!<br>Lead them safely by the hand.<br><br>Where no fruit appears to cheer them,<br>And they seem to toil in vain,<br>Then in mercy, Lord, draw near them,<br>Then their sinking hopes sustain;<br>Thus supported,<br>Let their zeal revive again.<br><br>In the midst of opposition,<br>Let them trust, O Lord, in Thee;<br>When success attends their mission,<br>Let Thy servants humble be;<br>Never leave them,<br>Till Thy face in heaven they see.<br><br>There to reap in joy for ever,<br>Fruit that grows from seed here sown,<br>There to be with Him who never<br>Ceases to preserve His own,<br>And with triumph,<br>Sing a Saviour's grace alone.<br><br><br>
