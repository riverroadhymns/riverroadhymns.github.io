Passing onward, quickly passing;<br>But I ask you whither bound?<br>Is it to the many mansions<br>Where eternal rest is found?<br>Passing onward, passing onward,<br>Tell me sinner, whither bound?<br><br>Passing onward, quickly passing,<br>Naught the wheels of time can stay!<br>Sweet the thought that some are going<br>To the realms of perfect day.<br>Passing onward, passing onward,<br>Christ their leader - Christ their way.<br><br>Passing onward, quickly passing,<br>Many on the downward road,<br>Careless of their soul's salvation,<br>Heeding not the call of God,<br>Passing onward, passing onward,<br>Trampling on the Saviour's blood.<br><br>Passing onward, quickly passing,<br>Time its course will quickly run;<br>Still we hear the fond entreaty<br>Of the ever-gracious One,<br>"Come and welcome, come and welcome,<br>Tis by Me that life is won."<br><br><br>
