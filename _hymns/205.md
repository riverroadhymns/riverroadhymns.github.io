Tidings, happy tidings! Hark, hark, the sound!<br>Hear the joyful echo through the world resound;<br>Christ the Lord proclaims them, hear and heed the call,<br>Come, ye starving ones that perish, room, room for all.<br><br>Chorus<br>Whosoever cometh, Jesus will receive.<br>Whosoever thirsteth, Jesus will relieve;<br>See the living fountain, flowing full and free;<br>O, that blessed "whosoever" - That means me!<br><br>Tidings, happy tidings! Hark, hark, they say:<br>Do not slight the warning; come, O, come today;<br>Christ, the loving Saviour, still repeats the call,<br>"Come, ye weary, heavy-laden, room, room for all."<br><br>Chorus<br>Whosoever cometh, Jesus will receive.<br>Whosoever thirsteth, Jesus will relieve;<br>See the living fountain, flowing full and free;<br>O, that blessed "whosoever" - That means me!<br><br>Tidings, happy tidings! Hark, hark, again,<br>Rushing o'er the mountain, sweeping o'er the plain,<br>Onward goes the message, 'tis the Saviour's call:<br>"Come, for everything is ready; room, room for al1!"<br><br>Chorus<br>Whosoever cometh, Jesus will receive.<br>Whosoever thirsteth, Jesus will relieve;<br>See the living fountain, flowing full and free;<br>O, that blessed "whosoever" - That means me!<br><br><br>
