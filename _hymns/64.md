I hear Thy welcome voice,<br>That calls me, Lord, to Thee,<br>For cleansing in Thy precious blood,<br>That flowed on Calvary.<br><br>Chorus<br>I am coming, Lord,<br>Coming now to Thee;<br>Trusting only in the blood<br>That flowed on Calvary.<br><br>Though coming weak and vile,<br>Thou dost my strength assure:<br>Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse,<br>Till spotless all and pure.<br><br>All hail, atoning blood!<br>All hail, redeeming grace!<br>All hail, the gift of Christ, our Lord,<br>Our strength and righteousness!<br><br><br>
