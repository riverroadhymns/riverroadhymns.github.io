My chains are snapt, the bonds of sin are broken,<br>And I am free;<br>O let the triumphs of His grace be spoken,<br>Who died for me.<br><br>O death! O grave! I do not dread your power,<br>The ransom's paid;<br>On Jesus, in that dark and dreadful hour,<br>My guilt was laid.<br><br>Yes, Jesus bore it, bore, in love unbounded,<br>What none can know;<br>He passed through death, and gloriously confounded<br>Our every foe.<br><br>And now He's risen, proclaim the joyful story,<br>The Lord's on high;<br>And we in Him are raised to endless glory,<br>And ne'er can die.<br><br>We wait to see the Morning Star appearing<br>In glory bright;<br>This blessed hope illumes with beams most cheering,<br>The hours of night.<br><br><br>
