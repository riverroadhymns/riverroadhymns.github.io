I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold,<br>I'd rather be His than have riches untold;<br>I'd rather have Jesus than houses or land,<br>I'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hand.<br><br>Chorus<br>Than to be the king of a vast domain<br>Or be held in sin's dread sway.<br>I'd rather have Jesus than anything<br>This world affords today.<br><br>I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause;<br>I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause;<br>I'd rather have Jesus than world-wide fame,<br>I'd rather be true to His holy name.<br><br>Chorus<br>Than to be the king of a vast domain<br>Or be held in sin's dread sway.<br>I'd rather have Jesus than anything<br>This world affords today.<br><br>He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom;<br>He's sweeter than honey from out the comb;<br>He's all that my hungering spirit needs,<br>I'd rather have Jesus and let Him lead.<br><br>Chorus<br>Than to be the king of a vast domain<br>Or be held in sin's dread sway.<br>I'd rather have Jesus than anything<br>This world affords today.<br><br><br>
