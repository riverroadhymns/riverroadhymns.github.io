Eternity! Time soon will end,<br>Its fleeting moments pass away;<br>O sinner, say, where wilt thou spend<br>Eternity's unchanging day<br>Shalt thou the hopeless horror see<br>Of hell for all eternity<br><br>Chorus<br>Eternity! Eternity!<br>Where wilt thou spend eternity<br><br>Eternity! O dreadful thought<br>For thee, a child of Adam's race,<br>If thou shouldst in thy sins be brought<br>To stand before the awful face,<br>From which the heaven and earth shall flee,<br>The throned One of eternity.<br><br>Chorus<br>Eternity! Eternity!<br>Where wilt thou spend eternity<br><br>Eternity! but Jesus died,<br>Yes, Jesus died on Calvary;<br>Behold Him thorn-crowned, crucified,<br>The spotless One made sin for thee,<br>O, sinner, haste! for refuge flee,<br>He saves, and for eternity.<br><br>Chorus<br>Eternity! Eternity!<br>Where wilt thou spend eternity<br><br>Eternity! behold the Lamb,<br>Once slain, now lives, exalted high.<br>He calls thee, sinner, by thy name<br>Just as thou art, to Him draw nigh;<br>Thy sins He bore to set thee free,<br>Believe, and live eternally.<br><br>Chorus<br>Eternity! Eternity!<br>Where wilt thou spend eternity<br><br>Tonight may be thy latest breath,<br>Thy little moment here be done;<br>Eternal woe, the second death,<br>Awaits the grace-rejecting one.<br>Thine awful destiny foresee,<br>Time ends, and then eternity.<br><br>Chorus<br>Eternity! Eternity!<br>Where wilt thou spend eternity<br><br><br>
