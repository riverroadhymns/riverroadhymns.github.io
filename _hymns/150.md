Rock of Ages! cleft for me,<br>Let me hide myself in Thee!<br>Let the water and the blood<br>From Thy riven side which flowed,<br>Be of sin the double cure,<br>Save me from its guilt and power.<br><br>Not the labour of my hands<br>Can fulfill Thy law's demands;<br>Could my zeal no respite know;<br>Could my tears for ever flow.<br>All for sin could not atone;<br>Thou must save, and Thou alone.<br><br>Nothing in my hand I bring;<br>Simply to Thy cross I cling;<br>Naked, come to Thee for dress:<br>Helpless, look to Thee for grace;<br>Vile, I to the fountain fly,<br>Wash me, Saviour, or I die!<br><br>While I draw this fleeting breath;<br>When my eyelids close in death;<br>Or when changed I mount above,<br>Still I'll triumph in Thy love.<br>Rock of Ages! cleft for me,<br>Let me hide myself in Thee!<br><br><br>
