I have been at the altar and witnessed the Lamb<br>Burnt wholly to ashes for me;<br>And watched its sweet savour ascending on high,<br>Accepted, O Father, by Thee.<br><br>And lo, while I gazed at the glorious sight,<br>A voice from above reached mine ears:<br>By this thine inquity's taken away,<br>And no trace of it on thee appears.<br><br>An end of thy sin has been made for thee here<br>By Him who its penalty bore,<br>With blood it is blotted eternally out<br>And I will not remember it more.<br><br>O Lord, I believe it, with wonder and joy,<br>Confirm Thou this precious belief;<br>While daily I learn that I am, in myself,<br>Of sinners the vilest and chief.<br><br><br>
