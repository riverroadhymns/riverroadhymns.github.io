There is a green hill far away,<br>Outside a city wall,<br>Where the dear Lord was crucified,<br>Who died to save us all.<br><br>We may not know, we cannot tell<br>What pains He had to bear;<br>But we believe it was for us<br>He hung and suffered there.<br><br>He died that we might be forgiven,<br>He died to make us good,<br>That we might go at last to heaven<br>Saved by His precious blood.<br><br>There was no other good enough<br>To pay the price of sin;<br>He only could unlock the gate<br>Of heaven and let us in<br><br>O dearly, dearly has He loved,<br>And we must love Him too,<br>And trust in His redeeming blood,<br>And try His works to do.<br><br><br>
