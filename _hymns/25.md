Come! hear the gospel sound,<br>Yet there is room!<br>It tells to all around,<br>Yet there is room!<br>Though guilty, now draw near,<br>Though vile, you need not fear,<br>With joy you now may hear,<br>Yet there is room!<br><br>God's love in Christ we see,<br>Yet there is room!<br>Greater it could not be,<br>Yet there is room!<br>His only Son He gave,<br>He's righteous now to save<br>All who on Him believe,<br>Yet there is room!<br><br>All things are ready, come!<br>Yet there is room!<br>Christ everything hath done,<br>Yet there is room!<br>The work is now complete,<br>Before the mercy seat,<br>A Saviour you shall meet,<br>Yet there is room!<br><br>God's house is filling fast<br>Yet there is room!"<br>Some soul will be the last,<br>Yet there is room!<br>Yes, soon salvation's day<br>From you will pass away,<br>Then grace no more will say,<br>Yet there is room!<br><br><br>
