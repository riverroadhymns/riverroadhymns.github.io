Perfect salvation, Jesus hath died!<br>Perfect forgiveness flows from His side;<br>Justice no longer lifteth the rod,<br>Satisfied wholly, answered in blood.<br><br>Chorus<br>This is my story this is my song,<br>Telling of Jesus all the day long.<br>This is my story this is my song,<br>Telling of Jesus all the day long.<br><br>Righteous remission now can be known,<br>Fullness of pardon right from the throne;<br>Now for the guilty mercy is free,<br>God can in Jesus answer each plea.<br><br>Chorus<br>This is my story this is my song,<br>Telling of Jesus all the day long.<br>This is my story this is my song,<br>Telling of Jesus all the day long.<br><br>Right of redemption now is the Lord's,<br>He, our new Kinsman - joy it affords!<br>He, the Redeemer, suffering the loss,<br>Peace is triumphant, won at the cross!<br><br>Chorus<br>This is my story this is my song,<br>Telling of Jesus all the day long.<br>This is my story this is my song,<br>Telling of Jesus all the day long.<br><br>Tell it out loudly, sweet is the sound!<br>Widely proclaim it all the world round:<br>None are too guilty pardon to have,<br>Christ is in glory waiting to save!<br><br>Chorus<br>This is my story this is my song,<br>Telling of Jesus all the day long.<br>This is my story this is my song,<br>Telling of Jesus all the day long.<br><br><br>
