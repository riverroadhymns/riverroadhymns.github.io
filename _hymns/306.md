I will never, never leave thee,<br>I will never thee forsake;<br>I will guard and save, and keep thee,<br>For My name and mercy's sake;<br>Fear no evil, fear no evil,<br>Only all My counsel take.<br>For I'll never, never leave thee,<br>I will never thee forsake.<br><br>When the storm is raging round thee,<br>Call on Me in humble prayer,<br>I will fold My arms about thee,<br>Guard thee with the tenderest care:<br>In the trial, in the trial,<br>I will make thy pathway clear.<br>For I'll never, never leave thee,<br>I will never thee forsake.<br><br>When the sky above is glowing,<br>And around thee all is bright,<br>Pleasure like a river flowing,<br>All things tending to delight,<br>I'll be with thee, I'll be with thee,<br>I will guide thy steps aright.<br>For I'll never, never leave thee,<br>I will never thee forsake.<br><br>When thy soul is dark and clouded,<br>Filled with doubt, and grief, and care,<br>Through the mist by which 'tis shrouded<br>I will make a light appear,<br>And the banner, and the banner<br>Of My love I will uprear,<br>For I'll never, never leave thee,<br>I will never thee forsake.<br><br><br>
