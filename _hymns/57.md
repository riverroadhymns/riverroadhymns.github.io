How solemn are the words,<br>And yet to faith how plain,<br>Which Jesus uttered while on earth,<br>"Ye must be born again."<br><br>"Ye must be born again!"<br>For so hath God decreed;<br>No reformation will suffice,<br>Tis life poor sinners need.<br><br>"Ye must be born again!"<br>And life in Christ must have;<br>In vain the soul elsewhere may go,<br>Tis He alone can save.<br><br>"Ye must be born again!"<br>Or never enter heaven;<br>Tis only blood-washed ones are there,<br>The ransomed and forgiven.<br><br>"Ye must be born again!"<br>Then look to Christ and live;<br>He is "the life" and waits in heaven<br>Eternal life to give.<br><br><br>
