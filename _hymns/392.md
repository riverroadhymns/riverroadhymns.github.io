Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,<br>Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;<br>Weep o'er the erring ones, lift up the fallen,<br>Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.<br><br>Chorus<br>Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,<br>Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.<br><br>Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting,<br>Waiting the penitent soul to receive.<br>Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;<br>He will forgive if they only believe.<br><br>Chorus<br>Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,<br>Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.<br><br>Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;<br>Strength for thy labour the Lord will provide;<br>On to the narrow way patiently win them;<br>Tell the poor wanderer a Saviour has died.<br><br>Chorus<br>Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,<br>Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.<br><br><br>
