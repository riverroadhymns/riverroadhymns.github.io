Come, let us all unite to sing,<br>God is love, God is love.<br>Let heaven and earth their praises bring;<br>God is love, God is love.<br>Let every soul from sin awake,<br>Each in his heart sweet music make<br>And sing with us, for Jesus' sake,<br>God is love, God is love.<br><br>O tell to earth's remotest bound,<br>God is love, God is love.<br>In Christ we have redemption found:<br>God is love, God is love.<br>His blood has washed our sins away,<br>His Spirit turned our night to day<br>And now we can rejoice to say,<br>God is love, God is love.<br><br>How happy is our portion here!<br>God is love, God is love.<br>His promises our spirits cheer;<br>God is love, God is love.<br>He is our sun and shield by day,<br>Our help, our hope, our strength, and stay,<br>He will be with us all the way.<br>God is love, God is love.<br><br>In glory we shall sing again,<br>God is love, God is love.<br>Yes, this shall be our lofty strain,<br>God is love, God is love,<br>Whilst endless ages roll along,<br>In concert with the heavenly throng,<br>This shall be still our sweetest song,<br>God is love, God is love.<br><br><br>
