We're travelling home to heaven above,<br>Will you go? will you go?<br>To sing the Saviour's dying love,<br>Will you go?<br>Millions have reached that blissful shore,<br>Their trials and their labours o'er,<br>And yet there's room for millions more;<br>Will you go? will you go?<br><br>We're going to walk the plains of light.<br>Will you go? will you go?<br>Far, far from death, and sin, and night,<br>Will you go?<br>The crown of life we then shall wear,<br>The Conqueror's palm we then shall bear,<br>And all the joys of heaven shall share,<br>Will you go? will you go?<br><br>The way to heaven is straight and plain,<br>Will you go? will you go?<br>But mind "Ye must be born again,"<br>Will you go?<br>The Saviour cries aloud to thee,<br>O sinner come, "Believe on Me,<br>And thou shalt My salvation see,"<br>Will you go? will you go?<br><br>Come all ye halting ones and say,<br>I will go! I will go!<br>I'll start the journey here today,<br>Let me go!<br>My old companions, fare you well,<br>I will not go with you to hell,<br>l mean with Jesus Christ to dwell,<br>I will go! I will go<br><br><br>
