Blessed be the fountain of blood,<br>To a world of sinners revealed;<br>Blessed be the dear Son of God;<br>Only by His stripes are we healed.<br>Though I' ve wandered far from His fold,<br>Bringing to my heart pain and woe,<br>Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,<br>And I shall be whiter than snow.<br><br>Chorus<br>Whiter than the snow,<br>Whiter than the snow,<br>Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,<br>And I shall be whiter than snow.<br><br>Thorny was the crown that He wore,<br>And the cross His body o'er came;<br>Grievous were the sorrows He bore,<br>But He suffered thus not in vain.<br>May I to that Fountain be led,<br>Made to cleanse my sins here below;<br>Wash me in the blood that He shed,<br>And I shall be whiter than snow.<br><br>Chorus<br>Whiter than the snow,<br>Whiter than the snow,<br>Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,<br>And I shall be whiter than snow.<br><br>Father, I have wandered from Thee,<br>Often has my heart gone astray;<br>Crimson do my sins seem to me:<br>Water cannot wash them away.<br>Jesus, to that Fountain of Thine,<br>Leaning on Thy promise I go,<br>Cleanse me by Thy washing divine,<br>And I shall be whiter than snow.<br><br>Chorus<br>Whiter than the snow,<br>Whiter than the snow,<br>Wash me in the blood of the Lamb,<br>And I shall be whiter than snow.<br><br><br>
