My Lord has garments so wondrous fine,<br>And myrrh their texture fills;<br>Its fragrance reaches this heart of mine,<br>With joy my being thrills.<br><br>Chorus<br>Out of the ivory palaces<br>Into a world of woe,<br>Only His great eternal love<br>Made my Saviour go.<br><br>His life had also its sorrow sore,<br>For aloes had a part;<br>And when I think of the cross He bore,<br>My eyes with tear-drops start.<br><br>Chorus<br>Out of the ivory palaces<br>Into a world of woe,<br>Only His great eternal love<br>Made my Saviour go.<br><br>His garments too were in cassia dipped,<br>With healing in a touch;<br>Each time my feet in some sin have slipped,<br>He took me from its clutch.<br><br>Chorus<br>Out of the ivory palaces<br>Into a world of woe,<br>Only His great eternal love<br>Made my Saviour go.<br><br>In garments glorious He will come<br>To open wide the door;<br>And I shall enter my heavenly home,<br>To dwell for evermore.<br><br>Chorus<br>Out of the ivory palaces<br>Into a world of woe,<br>Only His great eternal love<br>Made my Saviour go.<br><br><br>
