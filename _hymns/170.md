The cross! the cross! the wondrous cross,<br>'Twas there the Saviour died;<br>I gaze upon that thorn-clad brow,<br>That pierced and bleeding side!<br><br>Chorus<br>At the cross! at the cross!<br>Where I first saw the light<br>And the burden of my heart rolled away.<br>It was there by faith I received my sight<br>And now I am happy all the day.<br><br>I see the burden of my sin<br>By God upon Him laid<br>And He, the spotless Lamb of God,<br>My sacrifice was made.<br><br>Chorus<br>At the cross! at the cross!<br>Where I first saw the light<br>And the burden of my heart rolled away.<br>It was there by faith I received my sight<br>And now I am happy all the day.<br><br>The cross of Christ is all my boast,<br>His blood my only plea;<br>My passport to the realms of bliss<br>Is - Jesus died for me<br><br>Chorus<br>At the cross! at the cross!<br>Where I first saw the light<br>And the burden of my heart rolled away.<br>It was there by faith I received my sight<br>And now I am happy all the day.<br><br><br>
