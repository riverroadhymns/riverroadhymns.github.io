Oh, turn ye, oh turn ye, for why will ye die,<br>When God in great mercy is coming so nigh?<br>Now Jesus invites you, the Spirit says, "Come,"<br>And angels are waiting to welcome you home.<br><br>How vain the delusion that while you delay,<br>Your hearts may grow better by staying away;<br>Come wretched, come starving, come just as you be<br>While streams of salvation are flowing so free.<br><br>In riches, in pleasure, what can you obtain<br>To soothe your affliction or banish your pain,<br>To bear up your spirit when summoned to die,<br>Or take you to Christ in the clouds of the sky?<br><br>And now Christ is ready your souls to receive,<br>And pardon you freely, if you will believe;<br>If sin is your burden, why will you not come?<br>Tis you He bids welcome; He bids you come home.<br><br><br>
