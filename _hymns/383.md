How sweet to work for Jesus!<br>How sweet as days go by,<br>To toil for Him, Who died for sin,<br>Our Master now on high.<br>Yes, work for Him is blessed,<br>More blest than tongue can tell;<br>We work and wait outside the gate,<br>Inside by faith we dwell.<br><br>How sweet to work for Jesus!<br>And now, at close of day,<br>Our songs of praise to Him we raise,<br>Who leads us on life's way.<br>We lift our eyes to heaven,<br>And See the glory shine<br>And now, tonight in Him delight<br>And say, "My Lord is mine?<br><br>How sweet to work for Jesus!<br>And each day nearer home,<br>To tell the love that beams above,<br>Until the Lord shall come.<br>To preach and sing of Jesus,<br>To pray for those in sin,<br>Until at last, the desert past,<br>We shall be home with Him.<br><br>How sweet to work for Jesus!<br>O, keep us close to Thee,<br>Until our feet rest on the street<br>Where faith's fair mansions be.<br>Until our eyes are gazing<br>Upon our Saviour's brow;<br>Till then we wait, outside the gate,<br>And work for Jesus now.<br><br><br>
