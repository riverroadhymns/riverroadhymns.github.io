Still undecided? Look to thy heart;<br>Grieve not the Spirit lest He depart.<br>Why wilt thou longer wait?<br>Come ere it be too late;<br>Jesus at mercy's gate<br>Grace will impart.<br><br>Still undecided? Slight not the voice<br>Breathing so kindly, "Make Me thy choice;<br>Look at my hands and see<br>I bore the nails for thee,<br>I died to make thee free,<br>Come and rejoice."<br><br>Still undecided? Time flies apace.<br>Jesus entreats thee; spurn not His grace.<br>What if the word were passed?<br>This night should be thy last;<br>Where would thy soul be cast?<br>Where hide thy face?<br><br>Still undecided? What shall we say?<br>Still undecided? Yet we will pray.<br>O! may the Spirit move!<br>O! may the God above<br>Melt thy poor heart to love,<br>Melt thee today!<br><br><br>
