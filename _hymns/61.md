I have a Friend whose faithful love<br>Is more than all the world to me,<br>Tis higher than the heights above,<br>And deeper than the soundless sea.<br>So old, so new, so strong, so true:<br>Before the earth received its frame<br>He loved me - Blessed be His name!<br><br>He held the highest place above,<br>Adored by all the sons of flame,<br>Yet, such His self-denying love,<br>He laid aside His crown and came<br>To seek the lost and, at the cost<br>Of heavenly rank and earthly fame,<br>He sought me - Blessed be His name!<br><br>It was a lonely path He trod,<br>From every human soul apart,<br>Known only to Himself and God<br>Was all the grief that filled His heart;<br>Yet from the track He turned not back,<br>Till where I lay in want and shame,<br>He found me - Blessed be His name!<br><br>Then dawned at last that day of dread<br>When, desolate, yet undismayed,<br>With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head<br>He, now forsaken and betrayed,<br>Went up for me to Calvary,<br>And, dying there in grief and shame,<br>He saved me - Blessed be His name!<br><br>Long as I live my song shall tell<br>The wonders of His matchless love;<br>And when at last I rise to dwell<br>In the bright home prepared above,<br>My joy shall be His face to see,<br>And bowing then with loud acclaim,<br>I'll praise Him - Blessed be His name!<br><br><br>
