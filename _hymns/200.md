They nailed my Lord upon the tree,<br>And left Him dying there;<br>Through love He suffered there for me,<br>Twas love beyond compare.<br><br>Chorus<br>Crucified, crucified!<br>And nailed upon the tree!<br>With pierced hands and feet and side!<br>For you! For me!<br><br>Upon His head a crown of thorns,<br>Upon His heart my shame;<br>For me He prayed, for me He died,<br>And dying, spoke my name.<br><br>Chorus<br>Crucified, crucified!<br>And nailed upon the tree!<br>With pierced hands and feet and side!<br>For you! For me!<br><br>"Forgive them, O, forgive!" He cried,<br>Then bowed His sacred head;<br>O Lamb of God! my sacrifice!<br>For me Thy blood was shed.<br><br>Chorus<br>Crucified, crucified!<br>And nailed upon the tree!<br>With pierced hands and feet and side!<br>For you! For me!<br><br>His voice I hear, His love I know,<br>I worship at His feet;<br>And kneeling there at Calvary's cross,<br>Redemption is complete.<br><br>Chorus<br>Crucified, crucified!<br>And nailed upon the tree!<br>With pierced hands and feet and side!<br>For you! For me!<br><br><br>
