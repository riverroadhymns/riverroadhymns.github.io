Come, sinners, behold what Jesus has done,<br>Behold how He suffered for thee:<br>They crucified Him, God's innocent Son,<br>Forsaken, He died on the tree!<br><br>Chorus<br>They crucified Him, they crucified Him,<br>They nailed Him to the tree,<br>And so there He died, a King crucified,<br>To save a poor sinner like me.<br><br>From heaven He came, He loved you - He died:<br>Such love as His, never was known;<br>Behold, on the cross the Lord crucified,<br>To make you an heir to His throne.<br><br>Chorus<br>They crucified Him, they crucified Him,<br>They nailed Him to the tree,<br>And so there He died, a King crucified,<br>To save a poor sinner like me.<br><br>There is nothing to do, for all has been done,<br>Just simply on Christ to believe;<br>And God has declared, all who trust in the Son,<br>The life everlasting receive.<br><br>Chorus<br>They crucified Him, they crucified Him,<br>They nailed Him to the tree,<br>And so there He died, a King crucified,<br>To save a poor sinner like me.<br><br><br>
