Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!<br>Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;<br>Redeemed through His infinite mercy,<br>His child, and for ever, I am.<br><br>Chorus<br>Redeemed! Redeemed!<br>Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.<br>Redeemed! Redeemed!<br>His child, and for ever; I am.<br><br>Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,<br>No language my rapture can tell;<br>I know that the light of His presence<br>With me doth continually dwell.<br><br>Chorus<br>Redeemed! Redeemed!<br>Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.<br>Redeemed! Redeemed!<br>His child, and for ever; I am.<br><br>I think of my blessed Redeemer,<br>I think of Him all the day long;<br>I sing, for I cannot be silent,<br>His love is the theme of my song.<br><br>Chorus<br>Redeemed! Redeemed!<br>Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.<br>Redeemed! Redeemed!<br>His child, and for ever; I am.<br><br>I know I shall see in His beauty<br>The King in whose law I delight,<br>Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps<br>And giveth me songs in the night.<br><br>Chorus<br>Redeemed! Redeemed!<br>Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.<br>Redeemed! Redeemed!<br>His child, and for ever; I am.<br><br>I know there's a crown that is waiting<br>In yonder bright mansions for me,<br>And soon, with the spirits made perfect,<br>At home with the Lord I shall be.<br><br>Chorus<br>Redeemed! Redeemed!<br>Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.<br>Redeemed! Redeemed!<br>His child, and for ever; I am.<br><br><br>
