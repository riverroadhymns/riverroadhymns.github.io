The sands of time are sinking,<br>The dawn of heaven breaks,<br>The summer morn I've sighed for,<br>The fair sweet morn awakes.<br>Dark, dark has been the midnight<br>But dayspring is at hand,<br>And glory, glory dwelleth<br>In Immanuel's land.<br><br>O! I am my Beloved's,<br>And my Beloved is mine;<br>He brings a poor vile sinner,<br>Into His house of wine.<br>I stand upon His merit,<br>I know no other stand,<br>Not e'en where glory dwelleth<br>In Immanuel's land.<br><br>O, Christ He is the fountain,<br>The deep sweet well of love;<br>The streams on earth I've tasted,<br>More deep I'll drink above;<br>There to an ocean's fullness<br>His mercy doth expand,<br>And glory, glory dwelleth<br>In Immanuel's land.<br><br>With mercy and with judgment<br>My web of time He wove,<br>And aye the dews of sorrow<br>Were lustered with His love.<br>I'll bless the hand that guided,<br>I'll bless the heart that planned,<br>When throned where glory dwelleth<br>In Immanuel's land.<br><br>The bride eyes not her garment<br>But her dear bridegrooms face;<br>I will not gaze at glory<br>But on the King of Grace.<br>Not at the crown He giveth<br>But on His pierced hand;<br>The Lamb is all the glory<br>Of Immanuel's land.<br><br><br>
