There's nothing like the old, old story,<br>Grace is free, grace is free!<br>Which saints and martyrs tell in glory,<br>Grace is free, grace is free!<br>It brought them through the flood and flame,<br>By it they fought and overcame,<br>And now they cry through His dear name,<br>Grace is free, grace is free!<br><br>Chorus<br>There's nothing like the old, old story<br>Grace is free, grace is free,<br>Which saints and martyrs tell in glory,<br>Grace is free, grace is free!<br><br>There's only hope in trusting Jesus,<br>Grace is free, grace is free!<br>From sin that doomed He died to free us,<br>Grace is free, grace is free!<br>Who would not tell the story sweet<br>Of love so wondrous, so complete<br>And fall in rapture at His feet!<br>Grace is free, grace is free!<br><br>Chorus<br>There's nothing like the old, old story<br>Grace is free, grace is free,<br>Which saints and martyrs tell in glory,<br>Grace is free, grace is free!<br><br>From age to age the theme is telling,<br>Grace is free, grace is free!<br>From shore to shore the strains are swelling,<br>Grace is free, grace is free!<br>And when that time shall cease to be,<br>And faith is crowned with victory,<br>'Twill sound through all eternity,<br>Grace is free, grace is free!<br><br>Chorus<br>There's nothing like the old, old story<br>Grace is free, grace is free,<br>Which saints and martyrs tell in glory,<br>Grace is free, grace is free!<br><br><br>
