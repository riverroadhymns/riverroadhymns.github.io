Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature,<br>O Thou of God and man the Son,<br>Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honour,<br>Thou, my soul's glory, joy and crown.<br><br>Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands,<br>Robed in the blooming garb of spring;<br>Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer,<br>Who makes the woeful heart to sing.<br><br>Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight,<br>And all the twinkling starry host;<br>Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer<br>Than all the angels heaven can boast.<br><br>Beautiful Saviour! Lord of all the nations!<br>Son of God and Son of Man!<br>Glory and honour, praise, adoration,<br>Now and forever more be Thine.<br><br><br>
