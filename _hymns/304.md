I serve a risen Saviour, He's in the world today;<br>I know that He is living, whatever men may say;<br>I see His hand of mercy, I hear His voice of cheer,<br>And just the time I need Him He's always near.<br><br>Chorus<br>He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today!<br>He walks with me and talks with me,<br>Along life's narrow way.<br>He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!<br>You ask me how I know He lives,<br>He lives within my heart.<br><br>In all the world around me I see His loving care,<br>And though my heart grows weary I never will despair;<br>I know that He is leading through all the stormy blast,<br>The day of His appearing will come at last.<br><br>Chorus<br>He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today!<br>He walks with me and talks with me,<br>Along life's narrow way.<br>He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!<br>You ask me how I know He lives,<br>He lives within my heart.<br><br>Rejoice, rejoice, O Christian, lift up your voice and sing<br>Eternal hallelujahs to Jesus Christ the King!<br>The Hope of all who seek Him, the Help of all who find,<br>None other is so loving, so good and kind.<br><br>Chorus<br>He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today!<br>He walks with me and talks with me,<br>Along life's narrow way.<br>He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!<br>You ask me how I know He lives,<br>He lives within my heart.<br><br><br>
