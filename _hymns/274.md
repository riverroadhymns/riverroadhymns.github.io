We'll sing of the Shepherd that died,<br>That died for the sake of the flock;<br>His love to the utmost was tried<br>But firmly endured as a rock.<br><br>When blood from a victim must flow,<br>This Shepherd, by pity was led<br>To stand between us and the foe<br>And willingly die in our stead.<br><br>Our song then forever should be<br>Of the Shepherd who gave Himself thus;<br>No subject so glorious as He,<br>No theme so affecting to us.<br><br>We'll sing of such subjects alone,<br>None other our tongues shall employ,<br>Till fully His love becomes known<br>In yonder bright regions of joy.<br><br><br>
