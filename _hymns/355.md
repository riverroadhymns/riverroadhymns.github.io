When this passing world is done;<br>When has sunk yon glaring sun;<br>When I stand with Christ on high,<br>Looking o'er life's history;<br>Then, Lord, shall I fully know,<br>Not till then, how much I owe.<br><br>When I stand before the throne,<br>Dressed in beauty not my own;<br>When I see Thee as Thou art,<br>Love Thee with unsinning heart;<br>Then, Lord, shall I fully know,<br>Not till then, how much I owe.<br><br>When the praise of heaven I hear,<br>Loud as thunders to the ear,<br>Loud as many waters noise,<br>Sweet as harp's melodious voice:<br>Then, Lord, shall I fully know,<br>Not till then, how much I owe.<br><br>Chosen not for good in me;<br>Wakened up from wrath to flee;<br>Hidden in the Saviour's side.<br>By the Spirit sanctified;<br>Teach me, Lord, on earth to show,<br>By my love, how much I owe.<br><br><br>
