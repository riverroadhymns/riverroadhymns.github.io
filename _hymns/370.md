We bless the name of Christ the Lord,<br>We bless Him for His holy Word,<br>Who loved to do His Father's will<br>And all His righteousness fulfill.<br><br>We follow Him with pure delight<br>To sanctify His sacred rite,<br>And thus our faith with water seal<br>To prove obedience that we feel.<br><br>Baptized in God the Father, Son<br>And Holy Spirit, Three in One,<br>With conscience free we rest in God,<br>In love and peace, through Jesus blood.<br><br>By grace we "Abba Father" cry,<br>By grace the Comforter comes nigh;<br>And for Thy grace our love shall be<br>For ever, only, Lord for Thee.<br><br><br>
