He tells me words whereby I'm saved,<br>He points to something done,<br>Accomplished on Mount Calvary<br>By His beloved Son,<br>In which no works of mine have place,<br>Else grace with works is no more grace.<br><br>Believing this, how can I wait,<br>And ask what shall I do<br>To make His gift more sure to me,<br>His loving words more true<br>Since works of mine have here no place,<br>Else grace with works is no more grace.<br><br>Ah, no! It is His finished work<br>On which my soul relies:<br>And if my unbelieving heart<br>Its preciousness denies,<br>That works of mine might have a place,<br>Then grace with works is no more grace.<br><br>But in that He is raised on high,<br>Who came our sins to bear,<br>I know that I am seen of God<br>In oneness with Him there;<br>Where not a spot His eyes can trace,<br>Nor aught that mars His work of grace.<br><br>O wondrous words! O precious work!<br>By which the soul is saved;<br>And Thou who didst it, blessed Lord,<br>Hast in my heart engraved<br>A Name which must all names displace<br>With me, a lost one, saved by grace.<br><br><br>
