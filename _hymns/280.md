Alas! and did my Saviour bleed,<br>And did my Sovereign die?<br>Would he devote that sacred head<br>For such a worm as I?<br><br>Was it for crimes that I have done,<br>He groaned upon the tree?<br>Amazing pity! grace unknown!<br>And love beyond degree!<br><br>Well might the sun in darkness hide<br>And shut his glories in,<br>When the incarnate Maker died<br>For man, His creature's sin.<br><br>Well might I hide my blushing face<br>While His dear cross appears;<br>Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,<br>And melt mine eyes to tears.<br><br>But drops of grief can ne'er repay<br>The debt of love I owe!<br>Here, Lord, I give myself away,<br>'Tis all that I can do.<br><br><br>
