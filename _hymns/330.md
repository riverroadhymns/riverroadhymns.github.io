Oh happy day! when first we felt<br>Our souls with deep contrition melt,<br>And saw our sins of crimson guilt,<br>All cleansed by blood on Calvary spilt.<br><br>Oh happy day! when first Thy love<br>Began our grateful hearts to move;<br>And gazing on Thy wondrous Cross,<br>We saw all else as worthless dross.<br><br>Oh happy day! when we no more<br>Shall grieve Thee whom our souls adore,<br>When sorrows, conflicts, fears shall cease,<br>And all our trials end in peace.<br><br>Oh happy day! when we shall see<br>And fix our longing eyes on Thee,<br>On Thee, our Light, our Life, our Love,<br>Our All below, our Heaven above.<br><br>Oh happy day of cloudless light!<br>Eternal day without a night;<br>Lord, when shall we its dawning see,<br>And spend it all in praising Thee?<br><br><br>
