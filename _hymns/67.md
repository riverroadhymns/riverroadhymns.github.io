I left it all with Jesus, long ago;<br>All my sins I brought Him, and my woe.<br>When by faith I saw Him on the tree,<br>Heard His still, small whisper, 'tis for thee,<br>From my heart the burden rolled away,<br>Happy day!<br>From my heart the burden rolled away,<br>Happy day!<br><br>I leave it all with Jesus, For He knows;<br>How to steal the bitter from life's woes;<br>How to gild the tear drop with His smile,<br>Make the desert garden bloom a while;<br>When my weakness leaneth on His might,<br>All seems light.<br>When my weakness leaneth on His might,<br>All seems light.<br><br>I leave it all with Jesus, day by day;<br>Faith can firmly trust Him, come what may.<br>Hope has dropped her anchor,<br>Found her rest<br>In the calm, sure haven of His breast;<br>Love esteems it heaven to abide at His side.<br>Love esteems it heaven to abide at His side.<br><br>O, leave it all with Jesus, drooping soul!<br>Tell not half thy story, but the whole.<br>Worlds on worlds are hanging on His Hand,<br>Life and death are waiting His command;<br>Yet His tender bosom makes thee room,<br>O, come home,<br>Yet His tender bosom makes thee room,<br>O, come home.<br><br><br>
