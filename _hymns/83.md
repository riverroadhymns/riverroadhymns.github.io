It is a thing most wonderful,<br>Almost too wonderful to be,<br>That God's own Son should come from heaven<br>And die to save a soul like me.<br><br>And yet I know that it is true:<br>He chose a poor and humble lot,<br>And wept, and toiled, and mourned, and died<br>For love of those who loved Him not.<br><br>I cannot tell how He could love<br>A child so weak and full of sin;<br>His love must be most wonderful,<br>If He could die my love to win.<br><br>It is most wonderful to know<br>His love for me, so free and sure;<br>But 'tis more wonderful to see<br>My love for Him so faint and poor.<br><br>And yet I Want to love Thee, Lord;<br>O, light the flame within my heart<br>And I will love Thee more and more,<br>Until I see Thee as Thou art.<br><br><br>
