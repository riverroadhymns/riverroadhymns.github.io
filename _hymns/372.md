Am I a soldier of the cross,<br>A follower of the Lamb?<br>And shall I fear to own His cause,<br>Or blush to speak His Name?<br><br>Chorus<br>In the Name, the precious Name,<br>Of Him who died for me,<br>By grace I'll win the promised crown,<br>Whate'er my cross may be.<br><br>Must I be carried to the skies<br>On flowery beds of ease,<br>While others fought to win the prize<br>And sailed through raging seas?<br><br>Chorus<br>In the Name, the precious Name,<br>Of Him who died for me,<br>By grace I'll win the promised crown,<br>Whate'er my cross may be.<br><br>Are there no foes for me to face?<br>Must I not stem the flood?<br>Is this vile world a friend to grace,<br>To help me on to God?<br><br>Chorus<br>In the Name, the precious Name,<br>Of Him who died for me,<br>By grace I'll win the promised crown,<br>Whate'er my cross may be.<br><br>Since I must fight if I would reign,<br>Increase my courage, Lord;<br>I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,<br>Supported by Thy Word.<br><br>Chorus<br>In the Name, the precious Name,<br>Of Him who died for me,<br>By grace I'll win the promised crown,<br>Whate'er my cross may be.<br><br>Thy saints, in all this glorious war,<br>Shall conquer, though they're slain,<br>They view the triumph from afar,<br>And shall with Jesus reign.<br><br>Chorus<br>In the Name, the precious Name,<br>Of Him who died for me,<br>By grace I'll win the promised crown,<br>Whate'er my cross may be.<br><br><br>
