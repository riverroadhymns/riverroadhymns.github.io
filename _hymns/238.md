Wounded for me, wounded for me,<br>There on the cross He was wounded for me;<br>Gone my transgressions, and now I am free,<br>All because Jesus was wounded for me.<br><br>Dying for me, dying for me,<br>There on the cross He was dying for me;<br>Now in His death my redemption I see,<br>All because Jesus was dying for me.<br><br>Risen for me, risen for me,<br>Up from the grave, He has risen for me;<br>Now evermore from death's sting I am free,<br>All because Jesus has risen for me.<br><br>Living for me, living for me,<br>Up in the skies, He is living for me;<br>Daily He's pleading and praying for me.<br>All because Jesus is living for me.<br><br>Coming for me, coming for me,<br>One day to earth He is coming for me;<br>Then with what joy His dear face I shall see,<br>O how I praise Him! He's coming for me.<br><br><br>
