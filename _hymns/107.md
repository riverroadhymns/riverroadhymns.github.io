O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found,<br>And found in Thee alone,<br>The peace, the joy, I sought so long,<br>The bliss till now unknown.<br><br>Chorus<br>Now none but Christ can satisfy,<br>None other name for me!<br>There's love, and life, and lasting joy,<br>Lord Jesus, found in Thee!<br><br>I sighed for rest and happiness,<br>I yearned for them, not Thee:<br>But while I passed the Saviour by,<br>His love laid hold on me.<br><br>Chorus<br>Now none but Christ can satisfy,<br>None other name for me!<br>There's love, and life, and lasting joy,<br>Lord Jesus, found in Thee!<br><br>I tried the broken cisterns, Lord,<br>But, ah! the waters failed!<br>E'en as I stooped to drink, they fled<br>And mocked me as I wailed.<br><br>Chorus<br>Now none but Christ can satisfy,<br>None other name for me!<br>There's love, and life, and lasting joy,<br>Lord Jesus, found in Thee!<br><br>The pleasures lost, I sadly mourned<br>But never wept for Thee,<br>Till grace the sightless eyes received<br>Thy loveliness to see.<br><br>Chorus<br>Now none but Christ can satisfy,<br>None other name for me!<br>There's love, and life, and lasting joy,<br>Lord Jesus, found in Thee!<br><br><br>
