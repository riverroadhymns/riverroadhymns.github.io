O shall I be amongst that throng,<br>All clothed in robes of white,<br>And help to swell that glorious song<br>Of rapture and delight?<br><br>Chorus<br>I shall, for I have been redeemed<br>With blood of worth untold,<br>The blood of Christ, the Lamb of God,<br>More precious for than gold.<br><br>Shall I, in glory, Christ behold,<br>Exalted King and Lord?<br>What rapture, yea, what bliss untold<br>That moment will afford!<br><br>Chorus<br>I shall, for I have been redeemed<br>With blood of worth untold,<br>The blood of Christ, the Lamb of God,<br>More precious for than gold.<br><br>O, shall I see my Saviour's face<br>All radiant as the sun;<br>And dwell through all eternity<br>With God's beloved One?<br><br>Chorus<br>I shall, for I have been redeemed<br>With blood of worth untold,<br>The blood of Christ, the Lamb of God,<br>More precious for than gold.<br><br>O, shall I gaze upon the wounds,<br>From whence has flowed the blood,<br>That cleansed my guilty, sinful heart,<br>And brought me nigh to God?<br><br>Chorus<br>I shall, for I have been redeemed<br>With blood of worth untold,<br>The blood of Christ, the Lamb of God,<br>More precious for than gold.<br><br>O, shall I ever with the Lord<br>As I retrace the past,<br>Praise Him for all His wondrous grace<br>To me from first to last?<br><br>Chorus<br>I shall, for I have been redeemed<br>With blood of worth untold,<br>The blood of Christ, the Lamb of God,<br>More precious for than gold.<br><br><br>
