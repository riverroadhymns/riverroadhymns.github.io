O, for a thousand tongues to sing<br>My great Redeemer's praise!<br>The glories of my God and King,<br>The triumphs of His grace.<br><br>Jesus, the name that charms our fears,<br>That bids our sorrows cease;<br>'Tis music in the sinner's ears,<br>'Tis life and health and peace.<br><br>He breaks the power of cancelled sin,<br>He sets the prisoner free;<br>His blood can make the foulest clean,<br>His blood availed for me.<br><br>See all your sins on Jesus laid:<br>The Lamb of God was slain,<br>His soul was once an offering made<br>For every soul of man.<br><br>He speaks and, listening to His voice,<br>New life the dead receive,<br>The mournful, broken hearts rejoice,<br>The humble poor believe.<br><br>My gracious Master and my God,<br>Assist me to proclaim,<br>And spread through all the earth abroad<br>The honours of Thy name.<br><br><br>
