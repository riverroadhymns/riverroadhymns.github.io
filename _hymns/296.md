He leadeth me, O blessed thought,<br>O words with heavenly comfort fraught;<br>Whate'er I do, where'er I be,<br>Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me!<br><br>Chorus<br>He leadeth me! He leadeth me!<br>By His own hand He leadeth me;<br>His faithful follower I would be,<br>For by His hand He leadeth me.<br><br>Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom,<br>Sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,<br>By Waters still, o'er troubled sea,<br>Still 'tis His hand that leadeth me.<br><br>Chorus<br>He leadeth me! He leadeth me!<br>By His own hand He leadeth me;<br>His faithful follower I would be,<br>For by His hand He leadeth me.<br><br>Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine,<br>And never murmur or repine,<br>Content, whatever lot I see,<br>Since 'tis my God that leadeth me.<br><br>Chorus<br>He leadeth me! He leadeth me!<br>By His own hand He leadeth me;<br>His faithful follower I would be,<br>For by His hand He leadeth me.<br><br>And when my task on earth is done,<br>When by Thy grace the victory's won,<br>E'en death's cold wave I will not flee,<br>If God through Jordan leadeth me.<br><br>Chorus<br>He leadeth me! He leadeth me!<br>By His own hand He leadeth me;<br>His faithful follower I would be,<br>For by His hand He leadeth me.<br><br><br>
