I heard the voice of Jesus say,<br>"Come unto Me and rest;<br>Lay down, thou weary one, lay down<br>Thy head upon My breast."<br>I came to Jesus as I was,<br>Weary, and worn, and sad;<br>I found in Him a resting place,<br>And He has made me glad.<br><br>I heard the voice of Jesus say,<br>"Behold, I freely give<br>The living water - thirsty one,<br>Stoop down and drink and live."<br>I came to Jesus and I drank<br>Of that life-giving stream;<br>My thirst was quenched, my soul was saved,<br>And now I live in Him.<br><br>I heard the voice of Jesus say,<br>"I am this dark world's light."<br>Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise<br>And all thy days be bright.<br>I looked to Jesus and I found<br>In Him my Star, my Sun;<br>And in that Light of Life I'll walk,<br>Till travelling days are done.<br><br><br>
