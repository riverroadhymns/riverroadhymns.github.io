From Salem's gates, advancing slow,<br>What object meets mine eyes<br>What means yon majesty of woe;<br>What mean yon mingled cries<br><br>Chorus<br>O, the blood of Jesus,<br>The precious blood of Jesus,<br>O, the blood of Jesus,<br>It cleanses from all sin.<br><br>Who can it be who toils beneath<br>Yon ponderous cross of wood<br>Whose soul's o'erwhelmed in floods of death,<br>Whose body's bathed in blood<br><br>Chorus<br>O, the blood of Jesus,<br>The precious blood of Jesus,<br>O, the blood of Jesus,<br>It cleanses from all sin.<br><br>Is this the Man, can this be He<br>The prophets have foretold,<br>Should with transgressors numbered be,<br>And for my crimes be sold<br><br>Chorus<br>O, the blood of Jesus,<br>The precious blood of Jesus,<br>O, the blood of Jesus,<br>It cleanses from all sin.<br><br>O lovely sight, O heavenly form,<br>For sinful souls to see;<br>I'll creep beside Him as a worm,<br>And see Him die for me.<br><br>Chorus<br>O, the blood of Jesus,<br>The precious blood of Jesus,<br>O, the blood of Jesus,<br>It cleanses from all sin.<br><br><br>
