On the cross, the Saviour hanging,<br>Bled and died for you and me;<br>Wondrous love! O! who can know it?<br>Boundless, priceless, full and free.<br><br>Chorus<br>On the cross behold Him hanging,<br>On the blood-stained cross for me,<br>Jesus died to bring salvation,<br>Jesus died for you and me.<br><br>O, the blood-stained cross of Jesus,<br>How it fills my soul with peace!<br>As I there behold Him dying,<br>Bringing naught but my release.<br><br>Tis indeed a truth most precious,<br>That for sinners Jesus died,<br>And we have a full remission<br>Through a Saviour crucified.<br><br><br>
