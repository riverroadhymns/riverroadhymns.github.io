I must needs go home by the way of the cross,<br>There's no other way but this;<br>I shall ne'er get sight of the gates of light<br>lf the way of the cross I miss.<br><br>Chorus<br>The way of the cross leads home,<br>The way of the cross leads home,<br>It is sweet to know, as I onward go,<br>The way of the cross leads home.<br><br>I must needs go on in the blood-sprinkled way,<br>The path that the Saviour trod,<br>If I ever climb to the heights sublime,<br>Where the soul is at home with God.<br><br>Chorus<br>The way of the cross leads home,<br>The way of the cross leads home,<br>It is sweet to know, as I onward go,<br>The way of the cross leads home.<br><br>Then I bid farewell to the way of the world,<br>To walk in it nevermore;<br>For my Lord says, "Come," and I seek my home<br>Where He waits at the open door.<br><br>Chorus<br>The way of the cross leads home,<br>The way of the cross leads home,<br>It is sweet to know, as I onward go,<br>The way of the cross leads home.<br><br><br>
