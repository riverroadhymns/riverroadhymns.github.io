I've a soul to be saved;<br>May this truth be engraved<br>On my mind and my heart while I'm young.<br>O, how awful the cost,<br>If my soul should be lost,<br>And in hell if I die as I am.<br><br>Chorus<br>Die as I am; yes, die as I am;<br>All hope gone for ever<br>If I die as I am.<br><br>Now the Lord at my door,<br>In His grace doth implore<br>That I open and let Him come in;<br>Ere He calls hence away<br>All the children of day,<br>And forever I'm left as I am.<br><br>Chorus<br>Left as I am; yes, left as I am;<br>All hope gone for ever<br>If I'm left as I am.<br><br>From my heart I implore<br>That He leave not my door<br>Till I open and let Him come in.<br>I may trust Him today,<br>Have my sins put away<br>And be saved if I come as I am.<br><br>Chorus<br>Come as I am, yes, come as I am;<br>Lost, guilty, and helpless,<br>I'll come just as I am.<br><br><br>
