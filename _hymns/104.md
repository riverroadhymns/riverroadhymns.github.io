Not all the gold of all the world<br>And all its wealth combined,<br>Could give relief or comfort yield<br>To one distracted mind.<br>'Tis only to the precious blood<br>Of Christ the soul can fly,<br>There only can the sinner find<br>A flowing full supply.<br><br>Chorus<br>O joyful news! O happy news!<br>The precious, precious blood<br>Of Christ can bring the sinner nigh,<br>And give him peace with God.<br><br>Was it for gold the dying thief,<br>The malefactor craved<br>Ah, no! 'twas Christ, and faith in Him<br>That dying sinner saved!<br>'Twas faith in Him, Who bleeding hung,<br>A Victim by his side;<br>"O Lord, remember me," he said,<br>"I will," he heard, and died.<br><br>Chorus<br>O joyful news! O happy news!<br>The precious, precious blood<br>Of Christ can bring the sinner nigh,<br>And give him peace with God.<br><br>Oh what can equal joy divine<br>And what can sweeter be,<br>Than knowing that the soul is safe<br>For all eternity<br>Safe in the Lord without a doubt,<br>By virtue of the blood;<br>For nothing can destroy the life<br>That's hid with Christ in God.<br><br>Chorus<br>O joyful news! O happy news!<br>The precious, precious blood<br>Of Christ can bring the sinner nigh,<br>And give him peace with God.<br><br><br>
