My Redeemer, O what beauties,<br>In that lovely name appear;<br>None but Jesus in His glories<br>Shall the honoured title wear.<br>My Redeemer, my Redeemer,<br>Thou hast my salvation wrought.<br><br>Sunk in ruin, sin, and misery,<br>Bound by Satan's captive chain,<br>Guided by his artful treachery,<br>Hurrying on to endless pain,<br>My Redeemer, my Redeemer,<br>Plucked me as a brand from hell.<br><br>Mine by covenant, mine for ever,<br>Mine by oath, and mine by blood;<br>Mine - nor time the bond shall sever,<br>Mine as an unchanging God.<br>My Redeemer, my Redeemer,<br>O, how sweet to call Thee mine!<br><br>When in heaven I see Thy glory,<br>When before Thy throne I bow,<br>Perfected I shall be like Thee,<br>Fully Thy redemption know.<br>My Redeemer, my Redeemer,<br>Then shall hear me shout His praise.<br><br><br>
