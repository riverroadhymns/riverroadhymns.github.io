There is forgiveness, God doth say,<br>Through the blood, through the blood;<br>Both sin and guilt are put away,<br>Through the blood, through the blood;<br>And sinners fitted for the sky,<br>Yes, unto God Himself brought nigh,<br>Made meet to dwell with Christ on high,<br>Through the blood, through the blood.<br><br>Tis not your work puts sin away,<br>But the blood, but the blood;<br>Nor is it gold, God's Word doth say,<br>But the blood, but the blood;<br>Yes, 'tis the blood, the precious Blood<br>Of Christ, the chosen Lamb of God,<br>That clears away sin's heavy load;<br>Precious blood! Precious blood!<br><br>You may be washed as white as snow<br>In the blood, in the blood;<br>And then to glory bright will go,<br>Through the blood, through the blood,<br>So come to Christ; O, come today,<br>That you may praise - yes, praise for aye,<br>The Lamb who washed your sins away,<br>In His blood, in His blood.<br><br>Thousands of souls in heaven will be,<br>Through the blood, through the blood,<br>Praising the Lamb, who on the tree<br>Shed His blood, shed His blood.<br>All white and pure, all glorious fair,<br>They praise the Lamb, whose joy they share:<br>O happy throng! will you be there<br>Through the blood, through the blood.<br><br><br>
