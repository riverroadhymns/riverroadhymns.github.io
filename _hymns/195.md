There's a story ever new,<br>It is wonderful and true,<br>And the best thing you can do is believe it.<br>It will calm your troubled breast,<br>And will give you peace and rest;<br>It's of all the news the best, O believe it.<br><br>Chorus<br>O believe it, O believe it;<br>Christ has died upon the tree,<br>That from sin you might be free;<br>O believe it, O believe it,<br>Jesus died for you and me - O believe it.<br><br>I was serving Satan well,<br>And in sin did far excel,<br>And would soon have been in hell, I believe it.<br>But the Saviour He drew near,<br>And He stopped my wild career,<br>For His gospel banished fear, I believed it.<br><br>Chorus<br>O believe it, O believe it;<br>Christ has died upon the tree,<br>That from sin you might be free;<br>O believe it, O believe it,<br>Jesus died for you and me - O believe it.<br><br>I could grace withstand no more,<br>For I saw my sins He bore,<br>So I entered by the Door and believed it.<br>Now I'm happy all the day;<br>I can sing as well as pray,<br>For my sins are washed away, I believe it.<br><br>Chorus<br>O believe it, O believe it;<br>Christ has died upon the tree,<br>That from sin you might be free;<br>O believe it, O believe it,<br>Jesus died for you and me - O believe it.<br><br><br>
