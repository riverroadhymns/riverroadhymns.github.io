Hark! the Saviour's voice from heaven<br>Speaks a pardon full and free;<br>Come, and thou shalt be forgiven;<br>Boundless mercy flows for thee,<br>Even thee, even thee,<br>Boundless mercy flows for thee.<br><br>See the healing fountain springing<br>From the Saviour on the tree;<br>Pardon, peace, and cleansing bringing,<br>Lost one, loved one, 'tis for thee,<br>Even thee, even thee,<br>Lost one, loved one, 'tis for thee.<br><br>Hear His love and mercy speaking,<br>Come, poor sinner, come to Me;<br>Though thy heart for sin be breaking<br>I have rest and peace for thee,<br>Even thee, even thee,<br>I have rest and peace for thee.<br><br>Every sin shall be forgiven,<br>Thou through grace a child shalt be;<br>Child of God, and heir of heaven,<br>Yes, a mansion waits for thee,<br>Even thee, even thee,<br>Yes, a mansion waits for thee.<br><br>Then in love for ever dwelling,<br>Jesus all thy joy shall be;<br>And thy song shall still be telling<br>All His mercy did for thee,<br>Even thee, even thee,<br>All His mercy did for thee.<br><br><br>
