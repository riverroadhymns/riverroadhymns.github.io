My soul is now united<br>To Christ the living vine,<br>His grace I long have slighted,<br>But now I know Him mine.<br>I was to God a stranger,<br>Till Jesus took me in;<br>He freed my soul from danger,<br>And pardoned all my sin.<br><br>Chorus<br>You shall give Him glory,<br>And I will give Him glory,<br>We all shall give Him glory,<br>For glory is His due.<br><br>Soon as my all I ventured<br>On the atoning blood,<br>The Holy Spirit entered<br>And I was born of God.<br>Now Christ is my salvation,<br>What can I covet more!<br>I fear no condemnation,<br>Jehovah's wrath is o'er.<br><br>Chorus<br>You shall give Him glory,<br>And I will give Him glory,<br>We all shall give Him glory,<br>For glory is His due.<br><br>By floods and flames surrounded,<br>I now my way pursue;<br>Nor shall I be confounded<br>With Jesus in my view.<br>I have a heavenly pleasure,<br>And do not fear a frown,<br>Christ is my joy and treasure,<br>My glory and my crown.<br><br>Chorus<br>You shall give Him glory,<br>And I will give Him glory,<br>We all shall give Him glory,<br>For glory is His due.<br><br>Christians, be not faint-hearted,<br>Though least among the flock;<br>From Christ you'll ne'er be parted,<br>When built upon the Rock.<br>Let's mend our pace to glory,<br>We soon shall meet above,<br>And tell the pleasing story<br><br>Chorus<br>You shall give Him glory,<br>And I will give Him glory,<br>We all shall give Him glory,<br>For glory is His due.<br><br><br>
