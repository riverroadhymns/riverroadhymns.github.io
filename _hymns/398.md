Take the name of Jesus with you,<br>Child of sorrow and of woe;<br>It will joy and comfort give you<br>Take it, then, where'er you go.<br><br>Chorus<br>Precious name, O, how sweet!<br>Hope of earth, and joy of heaven.<br><br>Take the name of Jesus ever,<br>As a shield from every snare;<br>If temptations round you gather<br>Breathe that holy name in prayer.<br><br>Chorus<br>Precious name, O, how sweet!<br>Hope of earth, and joy of heaven.<br><br>O, the precious name of Jesus!<br>How it thrills our souls with joy,<br>When His loving arms receive us<br>And His songs our tongues employ!<br><br>Chorus<br>Precious name, O, how sweet!<br>Hope of earth, and joy of heaven.<br><br>At the name of Jesus bowing,<br>Falling prostrate at His feet;<br>King of kings in heaven we'll crown Him,<br>When our journey is complete.<br><br>Chorus<br>Precious name, O, how sweet!<br>Hope of earth, and joy of heaven.<br><br><br>
