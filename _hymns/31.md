Come to the Saviour, come to the Saviour,<br>All ye who are burdened with sin,<br>He left His throne above,<br>To reveal His wondrous love,<br>And to open a fountain for sin.<br><br>Chorus<br>I do believe it! I do believe it!<br>I'm saved through the blood of the Lamb.<br>My happy soul is free,<br>For the Lord has pardoned me,<br>Hallelujah to His blessed Name.<br><br>Why dost thou linger, Why dost thou linger?<br>O, when wilt thou haste to be saved?<br>Thy time is flying fast,<br>And thy day will soon be past,<br>O, arouse thee, and come and be saved.<br><br>Chorus<br>I do believe it! I do believe it!<br>I'm saved through the blood of the Lamb.<br>My happy soul is free,<br>For the Lord has pardoned me,<br>Hallelujah to His blessed Name.<br><br>Pardon is offered, pardon is offered,<br>A pardon full, present, and free;<br>The mighty debt was paid,<br>When on Calvary Jesus died,<br>To atone for a rebel like thee.<br><br>Chorus<br>I do believe it! I do believe it!<br>I'm saved through the blood of the Lamb.<br>My happy soul is free,<br>For the Lord has pardoned me,<br>Hallelujah to His blessed Name.<br><br><br>
