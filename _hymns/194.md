There's a line that is drawn by rejecting our Lord,<br>Where the call of His Spirit is lost,<br>And you hurry along with the pleasure-mad throng,<br>Have you counted, have you counted the cost?<br><br>Chorus<br>Have you counted the cost,<br>If your soul should be lost,<br>Though you gain the whole world for your own?<br>Even now it may be,<br>That the line you have crossed,<br>Have you counted,<br>Have you counted the cost?<br><br>You may barter your hope of eternity's morn,<br>For a moment of joy at the most,<br>For the glitter of sin, and the things it will win,<br>Have you counted, have you counted the cost?<br><br>Chorus<br>Have you counted the cost,<br>If your soul should be lost,<br>Though you gain the whole world for your own?<br>Even now it may be,<br>That the line you have crossed,<br>Have you counted,<br>Have you counted the cost?<br><br>While the door of His mercy is open to you,<br>Ere the depth of His love you exhaust,<br>Won't you come and be healed,<br>Won't you whisper, I yield,<br>I have counted, I have counted the cost.<br><br><br>
