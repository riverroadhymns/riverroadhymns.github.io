Over the mountains so bleak and so cold,<br>Far from the beautiful city of gold,<br>Lost ones are straying because you and I<br>Never have told them a Saviour stood nigh.<br><br>Chorus<br>O won't somebody tell them?<br>Tell them of Calvary's tree;<br>Tell them the story of Jesus,<br>What a great Saviour is He!<br><br>Lost ones are groping in sin's awful night,<br>Falling and dying away from the right;<br>Many the message of Christ never heard,<br>Lost ones for whom no one ever has cared.<br><br>Chorus<br>O won't somebody tell them?<br>Tell them of Calvary's tree;<br>Tell them the story of Jesus,<br>What a great Saviour is He!<br><br>Speed with the message, O speed in His name!<br>Hasten the story of Christ to proclaim!<br>Hasten to bring back the fallen and lost!<br>Speed with the message, whatever the cost!<br><br>Chorus<br>O won't somebody tell them?<br>Tell them of Calvary's tree;<br>Tell them the story of Jesus,<br>What a great Saviour is He!<br><br><br>
