Ransomed saints, your voices raise,<br>Jesus saves, Jesus saves!<br>Sing aloud your heavenly lays,<br>Jesus saves, Jesus saves!<br>Whisper in the sinner's ears,<br>Not thy works, and not thy tears,<br>Can dispel thy guilty fears,<br>Jesus saves, Jesus saves!<br><br>Yes, He died upon the cross,<br>Jesus saves, Jesus saves!<br>There He suffered shame and loss,<br>Jesus saves, Jesus saves!<br>There He did for sin atone,<br>Dying on that cross alone;<br>Now upon the Father's throne,<br>Jesus saves, Jesus saves!<br><br>Tell the joyous news around,<br>Jesus saves, Jesus saves!<br>Make the very heavens resound,<br>Jesus saves, Jesus saves!<br>Weary not to tell the news,<br>That if thousands still refuse,<br>All shall be without excuse:<br>Jesus saves, Jesus saves!<br><br>Soon the heavens shall hear His voice,<br>Jesus saves, Jesus saves!<br>Then His people will rejoice,<br>Jesus saves, Jesus saves!<br>When He calls His own away,<br>Never more shall mercy say,<br>This is still salvation's day,<br>Jesus saves, Jesus saves!<br><br><br>
