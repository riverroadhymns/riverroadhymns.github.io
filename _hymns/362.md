Buried in the grave of Jesus,<br>We believe what God has said;<br>Faith His judgment acquiescing,<br>Reckons now that we are dead.<br><br>Death and judgment are behind us,<br>Grace and glory are before,<br>All the billows rolled o'er Jesus<br>There exhausted all their power.<br><br>First-fruits of the resurrection,<br>He is risen from the tomb;<br>Now we stand in new creation,<br>Free, because beyond our doom.<br><br>Jesus died and we died with Him,<br>Buried in His grave we lie,<br>One with Christ in resurrection,<br>Seated now in Him on high.<br><br>We await the full redemption<br>When the risen One shall come<br>And our mortal body changed,<br>Shall be fashioned like His own.<br><br>Lord, we share in Thy rejection,<br>Thy reproach, O, may we love;<br>Here we stand in Thine acceptance<br>In the Father's sight above.<br><br><br>
