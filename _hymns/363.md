I am Thine, O Lord! I have heard Thy voice<br>And it told Thy love to me;<br>But I long to rise in the arms of faith<br>And be closer drawn to Thee.<br><br>Chorus<br>Draw me nearer; nearer blessed Lord<br>To the cross where Thou hast died.<br>Draw me nearer; nearer; nearer blessed Lord,<br>To Thy precious wounded side.<br><br>Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,<br>By the power of grace divine;<br>Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope<br>And my will be lost in Thine.<br><br>Chorus<br>Draw me nearer; nearer blessed Lord<br>To the cross where Thou hast died.<br>Draw me nearer; nearer; nearer blessed Lord,<br>To Thy precious wounded side.<br><br>O, the pure delight of a single hour<br>That before Thy throne I spend,<br>When I kneel in prayer and with Thee, my God,<br>I commune as friend with friend.<br><br>Chorus<br>Draw me nearer; nearer blessed Lord<br>To the cross where Thou hast died.<br>Draw me nearer; nearer; nearer blessed Lord,<br>To Thy precious wounded side.<br><br>There are depths of love that I cannot know<br>Till I cross the narrow sea;<br>There are heights of joy that I may not reach<br>Till I rest in peace with Thee.<br><br>Chorus<br>Draw me nearer; nearer blessed Lord<br>To the cross where Thou hast died.<br>Draw me nearer; nearer; nearer blessed Lord,<br>To Thy precious wounded side.<br><br><br>
