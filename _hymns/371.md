When we walk with the Lord<br>In the light of His Word,<br>What a glory He sheds on our way!<br>While we do His good will<br>He abides with us still,<br>And with all who will trust and obey.<br><br>Chorus<br>Trust and obey, for there's no other way<br>To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.<br><br>Not a shadow can rise,<br>Not a cloud in the skies,<br>But His smile quickly drives it away;<br>Not a doubt nor a fear,<br>Not a sigh nor a tear<br>Can abide while we trust and obey.<br><br>Chorus<br>Trust and obey, for there's no other way<br>To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.<br><br>Not a burden we bear,<br>Not a sorrow we share<br>But our toil He doth richly repay;<br>Not a grief nor a loss,<br>Not a frown nor a cross,<br>But is blest if we mist and obey.<br><br>Chorus<br>Trust and obey, for there's no other way<br>To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.<br><br>But we never can prove<br>The delights of His love<br>Until all on the altar we lay;<br>For the favour He shows<br>And the joy He bestows<br>Are for them who will trust and obey.<br><br>Chorus<br>Trust and obey, for there's no other way<br>To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.<br><br>Then in fellowship sweet<br>We will sit at His feet,<br>Or we'll walk by His side in the way;<br>What He says we will do,<br>Where He sends we will go,<br>Never fear, only trust and obey.<br><br><br>
