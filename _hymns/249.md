Face to face with Christ, my Saviour,<br>Face to face - what will it be?<br>When with rapture I behold Him,<br>Jesus Christ, who died for me.<br><br>Chorus<br>Face to face shall I behold Him,<br>Far beyond the starry sky;<br>Face to face in all His glory,<br>I shall see Him by and by!<br><br>Only faintly now I see Him,<br>With the darkening veil between,<br>But a blessed day is coming<br>When His glory shall be seen.<br><br>Chorus<br>Face to face shall I behold Him,<br>Far beyond the starry sky;<br>Face to face in all His glory,<br>I shall see Him by and by!<br><br>What rejoicing in His presence,<br>When are banished grief and pain;<br>When the crooked ways are straightened<br>And the dark things shall be plain.<br><br>Chorus<br>Face to face shall I behold Him,<br>Far beyond the starry sky;<br>Face to face in all His glory,<br>I shall see Him by and by!<br><br>Face to face! O blissful moment!<br>Face to face - to see and know;<br>Face to face with my Redeemer,<br>Jesus Christ, who loves me so.<br><br>Chorus<br>Face to face shall I behold Him,<br>Far beyond the starry sky;<br>Face to face in all His glory,<br>I shall see Him by and by!<br><br><br>
