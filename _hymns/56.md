Himself He could not save,<br>He on the cross must die,<br>Or mercy cannot come<br>To ruined sinners nigh:<br>Yes, Christ the Son of God must bleed<br>That sinners might from sin be freed.<br><br>Himself He could not save,<br>For justice must be done;<br>And sin's full weight must fall<br>Upon a sinless one;<br>For nothing else could God accept<br>In payment of the fearful debt.<br><br>Himself He could not save,<br>For He the surety stood<br>For all who now rely<br>Upon His precious blood.<br>He bore the penalty for thee<br>When dying on the accursed tree.<br><br>Himself He could not save,<br>Yet, now a Saviour, He<br>Bids sinners to Him come,<br>And live eternally.<br>Believing in Him now, we prove<br>His saving power, His changeless love.<br><br><br>
