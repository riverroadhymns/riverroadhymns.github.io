I've wandered far away from God,<br>Now I'm coming home;<br>The paths of sin too long I've trod,<br>Lord, I'm coming home.<br><br>Chorus<br>Coming home, coming home,<br>Never more to roam;<br>Open wide Thine arms of love,<br>Lord, I'm coming home.<br><br>I've wasted many precious years,<br>Now I'm coming home;<br>I now repent with bitter tears,<br>Lord, I'm coming home.<br><br>Chorus<br>Coming home, coming home,<br>Never more to roam;<br>Open wide Thine arms of love,<br>Lord, I'm coming home.<br><br>I'm tired of sin and straying, Lord,<br>Now I'm coming home;<br>I'll trust Thy love, believe Thy Word,<br>Lord, I'm coming home.<br><br>Chorus<br>Coming home, coming home,<br>Never more to roam;<br>Open wide Thine arms of love,<br>Lord, I'm coming home.<br><br><br>
