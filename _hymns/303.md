In shady green pastures, so rich and so sweet,<br>God leads His dear children along;<br>Where the water's cool flow bathes the weary one's feet,<br>God leads His dear children along.<br><br>Chorus<br>Some through the waters, some through the flood,<br>Some through the fire, but all through the blood;<br>Some through great sorrow but God gives a song<br>In the night season and all the day long.<br><br>Sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright,<br>God leads His dear children along;<br>Sometimes in the valley, in darkest of night,<br>God leads His dear children along.<br><br>Chorus<br>Some through the waters, some through the flood,<br>Some through the fire, but all through the blood;<br>Some through great sorrow but God gives a song<br>In the night season and all the day long.<br><br>Though sorrows befall us and Satan oppose,<br>God leads His dear children along;<br>Through grace we can conquer, defeat all our foes,<br>God leads His dear children along.<br><br>Chorus<br>Some through the waters, some through the flood,<br>Some through the fire, but all through the blood;<br>Some through great sorrow but God gives a song<br>In the night season and all the day long.<br><br><br>
