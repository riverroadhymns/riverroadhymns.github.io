"Man of Sorrows," what a Name<br>For the Son of God, Who came<br>Ruined sinners to reclaim!<br>Hallelujah! What a Saviour!<br><br>Bearing shame and scoffing rude,<br>In my place condemned He stood;<br>Sealed my pardon with His blood;<br>Hallelujah! What a Saviour!<br><br>Guilty, vile and helpless, we;<br>Spotless Lamb of God was He;<br>"Full atonement" - can it be!<br>Hallelujah! What a Saviour!<br><br>"Lifted up" was He to die,<br>"It is finished!" was His cry;<br>Now in heaven exalted high;<br>Hallelujah! What a Saviour!<br><br>Soon He'll come with shout on high,<br>Raise His saints, no more to die;<br>Changed, we'll meet Him in the sky;<br>Hallelujah! What a Saviour!<br><br>When He comes, our glorious King,<br>All His ransomed home to bring,<br>Then anew this song we'll sing:<br>Hallelujah! What a Saviour!<br><br><br>
