All the way my Saviour leads me;<br>What have I to ask beside?<br>Can I doubt His tender mercy,<br>Who through life has been my guide?<br>Heavenly peace, divinest comfort,<br>Here by faith in Him to dwell!<br>For I know, whate'er befall me,<br>Jesus doeth all things well.<br><br>All the way my Saviour leads me,<br>Cheers each winding path I tread,<br>Gives me grace for every trial,<br>Feeds me with the living bread.<br>Though my weary steps may falter<br>And my soul athirst may be,<br>Gushing from the Rock before me,<br>Lo, a spring of joy I see!<br><br>All the way my Saviour leads me;<br>O, the fullness of His love!<br>Perfect rest to me is promised<br>In my Father's house above.<br>When my spirit, clothed, immortal,<br>Wings its flight to realms of day,<br>This my song through endless ages,<br>Jesus led me all the way!<br><br><br>
