To God be the glory! Great things He hath done;<br>So loved He the world that He gave us His Son;<br>Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,<br>And opened the Life-gate that all may go in.<br><br>Chorus<br>Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!<br>Let the earth hear His voice!<br>Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!<br>Let His people rejoice!<br>O, come to the Father through Jesus the Son,<br>And give Him the glory!<br>Great things He hath done.<br><br>O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,<br>To every believer the free gift of God;<br>The vilest offender who truly believes,<br>That moment, through Jesus, a pardon receives.<br><br>Chorus<br>Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!<br>Let the earth hear His voice!<br>Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!<br>Let His people rejoice!<br>O, come to the Father through Jesus the Son,<br>And give Him the glory!<br>Great things He hath done.<br><br>Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,<br>And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;<br>But purer, and higher, and greater will be<br>Our wonder, our triumph, when Jesus we see.<br><br>Chorus<br>Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!<br>Let the earth hear His voice!<br>Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!<br>Let His people rejoice!<br>O, come to the Father through Jesus the Son,<br>And give Him the glory!<br>Great things He hath done.<br><br><br>
