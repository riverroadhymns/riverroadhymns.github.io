Lord dismiss us with Thy blessing,<br>Fill our hearts with joy and peace;<br>Let us each, Thy love possessing,<br>Triumph in redeeming grace;<br>O refresh us, O refresh us,<br>Travelling through this wilderness.<br><br>Thanks we give and adoration<br>For Thy gospel's joyful sound;<br>May the fruits of Thy salvation<br>In our hearts and lives abound;<br>Ever faithful, ever faithful<br>To the truth may we be found.<br><br>So, whene'er the signal's given<br>Us from earth to call away.<br>Upward borne by Thee to heaven,<br>Glad the summons to obey,<br>We shall ever, we shall ever<br>Reign with Thee in endless day.<br><br><br>
