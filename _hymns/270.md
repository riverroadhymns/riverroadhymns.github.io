Sovereign grace! o'er sin abounding,<br>Ransomed souls, the tidings swell;<br>"Tis a deep that knows no sounding,<br>Who its breadth or length can tell?<br>On its glories<br>Let my soul for ever dwell!<br><br>What from Christ the soul can sever,<br>Bound by everlasting bands?<br>Once in Him, in Him for ever,<br>Thus the eternal covenant stands.<br>None shall pluck thee<br>From the strength of Israel's hands.<br><br>Heirs of God, joint-heirs with Jesus,<br>Long ere time its race began;<br>To His Name eternal praises,<br>O what wonders love hath done!<br>One with Jesus,<br>By eternal union one.<br><br>On such love, my soul, still ponder,<br>Love so great, so rich, so free!<br>Say, while lost in holy wonder,<br>Why, O Lord, such love to me?<br>Hallelujah!<br>Grace shall reign eternally.<br><br><br>
