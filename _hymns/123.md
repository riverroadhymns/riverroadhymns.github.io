O, what a gift the Father gave<br>When He bestowed His Son<br>To save poor, ruined, guilty man,<br>By sin defiled, undone!<br><br>Chorus<br>O, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love,<br>The love of God to me;<br>It brought my Saviour from above,<br>To die on Calvary.<br><br>For I was lost and vile indeed,<br>To every sin a prey,<br>Till God in mercy interposed,<br>And turned my night to day.<br><br>Chorus<br>O, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love,<br>The love of God to me;<br>It brought my Saviour from above,<br>To die on Calvary.<br><br>Now I can call the Saviour mine,<br>Though all unworthy still;<br>I'm sheltered by His precious blood,<br>Beyond the reach of ill.<br><br>Chorus<br>O, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love,<br>The love of God to me;<br>It brought my Saviour from above,<br>To die on Calvary.<br><br>Come all who trust in Jesus now<br>And tell our joys abroad;<br>Let thankful hymns of praise ascend<br>For Christ the gift of God.<br><br>Chorus<br>O, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love,<br>The love of God to me;<br>It brought my Saviour from above,<br>To die on Calvary.<br><br><br>
