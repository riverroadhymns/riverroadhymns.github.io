Out of my bondage, sorrow, and night,<br>Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!<br>Into Thy freedom, gladness and light,<br>Jesus, I come to Thee!<br>Out of my sickness into Thy health,<br>Out of my want and into Thy wealth,<br>Out of my sin and into Thyself,<br>Jesus, I come to Thee!<br><br>Out of my shameful failure and loss,<br>Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!<br>Into the glorious gain of Thy cross,<br>Jesus, I come to Thee!<br>Out of earth's sorrows into Thy balm,<br>Out of life's storm and into Thy calm,<br>Out of distress to jubilant psalm,<br>Jesus, I come to Thee!<br><br>Out of unrest and arrogant pride,<br>Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!<br>Into Thy blessed will to abide,<br>Jesus, I come to Thee!<br>Out of myself to dwell in Thy love,<br>Out of despair into raptures above,<br>Upward for aye on wings like a dove,<br>Jesus, I come to Thee!<br><br>Out of the fear and dread of the tomb,<br>Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!<br>Into the joy and light of Thy home,<br>Jesus, I come to Thee!<br>Out of the depths of ruin untold,<br>Into the peace of Thy sheltering fold,<br>Ever Thy glorious face to behold,<br>Jesus, I come to Thee!<br><br><br>
