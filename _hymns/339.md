Simply trusting every day,<br>Trusting through a stormy way;<br>Even when my faith is small,<br>Trusting Jesus, that is all.<br><br>Chorus<br>Trusting as the moments fly,<br>Trusting as the days go by<br>Trusting Him whate'er befall,<br>Trusting Jesus, that is all.<br><br>Brightly doth His Spirit shine<br>Into this poor heart of mine.<br>While He leads I cannot fall,<br>Trusting Jesus, that is all.<br><br>Chorus<br>Trusting as the moments fly,<br>Trusting as the days go by<br>Trusting Him whate'er befall,<br>Trusting Jesus, that is all.<br><br>Singing, if my way is clear,<br>Praying, if the path be drear;<br>If in danger, for Him call,<br>Trusting Jesus, that is all.<br><br>Chorus<br>Trusting as the moments fly,<br>Trusting as the days go by<br>Trusting Him whate'er befall,<br>Trusting Jesus, that is all.<br><br>Trusting Him while life shall last,<br>Trusting Him till earth is past,<br>Till within the jasper wall,<br>Trusting Jesus, that is all.<br><br>Chorus<br>Trusting as the moments fly,<br>Trusting as the days go by<br>Trusting Him whate'er befall,<br>Trusting Jesus, that is all.<br><br><br>
