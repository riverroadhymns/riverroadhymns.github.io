Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious;<br>See the Man of Sorrows now;<br>From the fight returned victorious,<br>Every knee to Him shall bow:<br>Crown Him! Crown Him!<br>Crown Him! Crown Him!<br>Crowns become the Victor's brow.<br><br>Crown the Saviour, angels crown Him,<br>Rich the trophies Jesus brings;<br>In the seat of power enthrone Him,<br>While the vault of heaven rings;<br>Crown Him! crown Him!<br>Crown Him! Crown Him!<br>Crown the Saviour, King of kings.<br><br>Sinners in derision crowned Him,<br>Mocking thus the Saviour's claim.<br>Saints and angels crowd around Him,<br>Own His title, praise His name:<br>Crown Him! crown Him!<br>Crown Him! Crown Him!<br>Spread abroad the Victor's fame.<br><br>Hark, those bursts of acclamation!<br>Hark! those loud triumphant chords!<br>Jesus takes the highest station;<br>O what joy the sight affords!<br>Crown Him! crown Him!<br>Crown Him! Crown Him!<br>King of kings and Lord of lords!<br><br><br>
