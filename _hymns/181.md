There are loved ones in the glory<br>Whose dear forms you often miss;<br>When you close your earthly story<br>Will you join them in their bliss?<br><br>Chorus<br>Will the circle be unbroken<br>By and by, by and by,<br>In a better home awaiting<br>In the sky, in the sky?<br><br>In the joyous days of childhood<br>Oft' they told of wondrous love,<br>Pointed to the dying Saviour;<br>Now they dwell with Him above.<br><br>Chorus<br>Will the circle be unbroken<br>By and by, by and by,<br>In a better home awaiting<br>In the sky, in the sky?<br><br>You remember songs of heaven<br>Which you sang with childish voice.<br>Do you love the hymns they taught you,<br>Or are songs of earth your choice?<br><br>Chorus<br>Will the circle be unbroken<br>By and by, by and by,<br>In a better home awaiting<br>In the sky, in the sky?<br><br>You can picture happy gatherings<br>Round the fireside long ago,<br>And you think of tearful partings<br>When they left you here below.<br><br>Chorus<br>Will the circle be unbroken<br>By and by, by and by,<br>In a better home awaiting<br>In the sky, in the sky?<br><br>One by one their seats were emptied,<br>One by one they went away.<br>Here the circle has been broken,<br>Will it be complete one day?<br><br>Chorus<br>Will the circle be unbroken<br>By and by, by and by,<br>In a better home awaiting<br>In the sky, in the sky?<br><br><br>
