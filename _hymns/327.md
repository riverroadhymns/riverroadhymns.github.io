My times are in Thy hand;<br>My God, I wish them there;<br>My life, my soul, my all, I leave<br>Entirely to Thy care.<br><br>My times are in Thy hand,<br>Whatever they may be;<br>Pleasing or painful, dark or bright,<br>As best may seem to Thee.<br><br>My times are in Thy hand,<br>Why should I doubt or fear?<br>A Father's hand will never cause<br>His child a needless tear.<br><br>My times are in Thy hand,<br>Jesus, the Crucified!<br>The hand my many sins have pierced<br>Is now my guard and guide.<br><br>My times are in Thy hand,<br>Jesus, my Advocate!<br>Nor can that hand be stretched in vain<br>For me to supplicate.<br><br><br>
