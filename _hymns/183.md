There is a door stands open wide<br>And through its portals gleaming<br>A radiance from the throne of light,<br>The God of love revealing.<br><br>Chorus<br>O depth of mercy. can it be<br>That door was opened wide for me,<br>For me, for me, was opened wide for me?<br><br>Christ is the door to heaven for all<br>Who seek through Him salvation;<br>The rich and poor, the great and small,<br>Of every tribe and nation.<br><br>Chorus<br>O depth of mercy. can it be<br>That door was opened wide for me,<br>For me, for me, was opened wide for me?<br><br>Press onward, then, though foes may frown,<br>While mercy's door is open;<br>Accept the cross, and win the crown,<br>Love's everlasting token.<br><br>Chorus<br>O depth of mercy. can it be<br>That door was opened wide for me,<br>For me, for me, was opened wide for me?<br><br>Beyond the river's brink we'll lay<br>The cross that here is given,<br>And bear the crown of life away<br>And love Him more in heaven.<br><br>Chorus<br>O depth of mercy. can it be<br>That door was opened wide for me,<br>For me, for me, was opened wide for me?<br><br><br>
