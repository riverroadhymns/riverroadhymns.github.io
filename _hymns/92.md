Just as I am without one plea,<br>But that Thy blood was shed for me,<br>And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,<br>O Lamb of God, I come, I come!<br><br>Just as I am - and waiting not<br>To rid my soul of one dark blot,<br>To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,<br>O Lamb of God, I come, I come!<br><br>Just as I am - though tossed about<br>With many a conflict, many a doubt,<br>Fightings within, and fears without,<br>O Lamb of God, I come, I come!<br><br>Just as I am - poor, wretched, blind:<br>Sight, riches, healing of the mind,<br>Yea, all I need in Thee to find,<br>O Lamb of God, I come, I come!<br><br>Just as I am - Thou wilt receive,<br>Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve,<br>Because Thy promise I believe<br>O Lamb of God, I come, I come!<br><br>Just as I am - Thy love unknown<br>Has broken every barrier down;<br>Now to be Thine, yea Thine alone,<br>O Lamb of God, I come, I come!<br><br><br>
