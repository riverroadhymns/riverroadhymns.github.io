We speak of the land of the blest,<br>That country so bright and so fair.<br>And oft are its glories confessed<br>But what must it be to be there?<br><br>Chorus<br>To be there! To be there!<br>O, what must it be to be there!<br>To be there! To be there!<br>O, what must it be to be there!<br><br>We speak of its peace and its love,<br>The robes which the glorified wear.<br>The songs of the blessed above;<br>But what must it be to be there?<br><br>Chorus<br>To be there! To be there!<br>O, what must it be to be there!<br>To be there! To be there!<br>O, what must it be to be there!<br><br>We speak of its freedom from sin,<br>From sorrow, temptation, and care;<br>From trials without and within;<br>But what must it be to be there?<br><br>Chorus<br>To be there! To be there!<br>O, what must it be to be there!<br>To be there! To be there!<br>O, what must it be to be there!<br><br><br>
