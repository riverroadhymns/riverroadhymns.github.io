Jesus shall reign where'er the sun<br>Doth its successive journeys run;<br>His kingdom spread from shore to shore,<br>Till moons shall wax and wane no more.<br><br>To Him shall endless prayer be made,<br>And endless praises crown His head;<br>His name like sweet perfume shall rise<br>With every morning sacrifice.<br><br>People and realms of every tongue<br>Dwell on His love with sweetest song;<br>And infant voices shall proclaim<br>Their early blessings on His name.<br><br>Blessings abound where'er He reigns,<br>The prisoner leaps to lose his chains;<br>The weary find eternal rest,<br>And all the sons of want are blest.<br><br>Let every creature rise and bring<br>Peculiar honours to our King;<br>Angels descend with songs again;<br>And earth repeat the loud Amen!<br><br><br>
