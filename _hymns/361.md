Around Thy grave, Lord Jesus,<br>Thine empty grave, we stand,<br>With hearts all full of praises,<br>To keep Thy blest command;<br>By faith, our souls rejoicing,<br>To trace Thy path of love<br>Through death's dark, angry billows,<br>Up to the throne above.<br><br>Lord Jesus, we remember<br>The travail of Thy soul,<br>When, in Thy love's deep pity<br>The waves did o'er Thee roll.<br>Baptized in death's cold waters,<br>For us Thy blood was shed;<br>For us Thou, Lord of Glory,<br>Wast numbered with the dead.<br><br>O, Lord, Thou now art risen,<br>Thy travail all is o'er!<br>For sin Thou once hast suffered,<br>Thou liv'st to die no more;<br>Sin, death, and hell are vanquished<br>By Thee, the Church's Head;<br>And lo! we share Thy triumphs,<br>Thou First-born from the dead.<br><br>Into Thy death baptized,<br>We own with Thee we died;<br>With Thee, our Life, we're risen<br>And in Thee glorified:<br>From sin, the world, and Satan,<br>We're ransomed by Thy blood,<br>And now would walk as strangers,<br>Alive with Thee to God.<br><br><br>
