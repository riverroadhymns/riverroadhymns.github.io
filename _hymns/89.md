Jesus is tenderly calling thee home,<br>Calling today! Calling today!<br>Why from the sunshine of love wilt thou roam<br>Farther and farther away<br><br>Chorus<br>Calling today, calling today,<br>Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today!<br><br>Jesus is calling the weary to rest,<br>Calling today! Calling today!<br>Bring Him thy burden and thou shalt be blest,<br>He will not turn thee away.<br><br>Chorus<br>Calling today, calling today,<br>Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today!<br><br>Jesus is waiting, O, come to Him now,<br>Waiting today! Waiting today!<br>Come with thy sins - at His feet lowly bow,<br>Come and no longer delay.<br><br>Chorus<br>Calling today, calling today,<br>Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today!<br><br>Jesus is pleading, O, list to His voice,<br>Hear Him today! Hear Him today!<br>They who believe on His name shall rejoice,<br>Quickly arise, come away.<br><br><br>
