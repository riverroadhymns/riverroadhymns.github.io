Have you read the story of the cross,<br>Where Jesus bled and died;<br>Where your debt was paid by His precious blood<br>That flowed from His wounded side?<br><br>Chorus<br>He died an atoning death for thee,<br>He died an atoning death;<br>O, wondrous love! it was for thee<br>He died an atoning death!<br><br>Have you read how they placed a crown of thorns<br>Upon His lovely brow?<br>When He prayed, "Forgive them, O! forgive,<br>They know not what they do."<br><br>Chorus<br>He died an atoning death for thee,<br>He died an atoning death;<br>O, wondrous love! it was for thee<br>He died an atoning death!<br><br>Have you read how He saved the dying thief<br>When hanging on the tree?<br>Who looked with pitying eyes and said,<br>"O Lord, remember me."<br><br>Chorus<br>He died an atoning death for thee,<br>He died an atoning death;<br>O, wondrous love! it was for thee<br>He died an atoning death!<br><br>Have you read that He looked to heaven and said,<br>"'Tis finished" - 'twas for thee?<br>Have you ever said, "I thank Thee, Lord,<br>For giving Thy life for me"?<br><br>Chorus<br>He died an atoning death for thee,<br>He died an atoning death;<br>O, wondrous love! it was for thee<br>He died an atoning death!<br><br><br>
