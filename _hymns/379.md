Hark the voice of Jesus crying,<br>"Who will go and work today?<br>Fields are white and harvest waiting,<br>Who will bear the sheaves away?"<br>Loud and strong the Master calleth,<br>Rich reward He offers thee,<br>Who will answer, gladly saying,<br>"Here am I, send me, send me."<br><br>If you cannot cross the ocean<br>And the heathen lands explore,<br>You can find the heathen nearer,<br>You can help them at your door.<br>If you cannot give your thousands,<br>You can give the widow's mite<br>And the least you do for Jesus<br>Will be precious in His sight.<br><br>Let none hear you idly saying,<br>"There is nothing I can do,"<br>While the souls of men are dying<br>And the Master calls for you.<br>Take the task He gives you gladly,<br>Let His work your pleasure be;<br>Answer quickly when He calleth,<br>"Here am I; send me, send me."<br><br><br>
