Like a river glorious<br>Is God's perfect peace,<br>Over all victorious<br>In its bright increase;<br>Perfect, yet it floweth<br>Fuller every day,<br>Perfect, yet it groweth<br>Deeper all the way.<br><br>Chorus<br>Stayed upon Jehovah<br>Hearts are fully blest;<br>Finding, as He promised,<br>Perfect peace and rest.<br><br>Hidden in the hollow<br>Of His blessed hand,<br>Never foe can follow,<br>Never traitor stand;<br>Not a surge of worry,<br>Not a shade of care,<br>Not a blast of hurry<br>Moves the spirit there.<br><br>Chorus<br>Stayed upon Jehovah<br>Hearts are fully blest;<br>Finding, as He promised,<br>Perfect peace and rest.<br><br>Every joy or trial<br>Falleth from above,<br>Traced upon our dial<br>By the Sun of love.<br>We may trust Him fully<br>All for us to do.<br>They who trust Him wholly<br>Find Him wholly true.<br><br>Chorus<br>Stayed upon Jehovah<br>Hearts are fully blest;<br>Finding, as He promised,<br>Perfect peace and rest.<br><br><br>
