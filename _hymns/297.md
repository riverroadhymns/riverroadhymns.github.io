How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,<br>Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word!<br>What more can He say, than to you He hath said,<br>You who to the Saviour for refuge have fled?<br><br>Fear not, I am with Thee, O, be not dismayed!<br>For I am thy God and will still give thee aid;<br>I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,<br>Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.<br><br>When through the deep waters I call thee to go,<br>The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow,<br>For I will be with thee, thy trials to bless,<br>And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.<br><br>When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,<br>My grace, all-sufficient, shall be thy supply;<br>The flame shall not hurt thee, I only design<br>Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine.<br><br>The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,<br>He will not, He will not desert to its foes;<br>That soul, though all hell should endeavour to shake,<br>He'll never, no never, no never forsake.<br><br><br>
