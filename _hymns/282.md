Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,<br>Anywhere He leads me in this world below;<br>Anywhere without Him, dearest joys would fade,<br>Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.<br><br>Chorus<br>Anywhere, anywhere, fear I cannot know,<br>Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.<br><br>Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone,<br>Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;<br>Even though He leads me over dreariest ways,<br>Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.<br><br>Chorus<br>Anywhere, anywhere, fear I cannot know,<br>Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.<br><br>Anywhere with Jesus, over land and sea,<br>Telling souls in darkness of salvation free;<br>Ready as He summons me to go or stay,<br>Anywhere with Jesus when He points the way.<br><br>Chorus<br>Anywhere, anywhere, fear I cannot know,<br>Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.<br><br>Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,<br>Though the darkening shadows round about me creep;<br>Knowing I shall waken, never more to roam,<br>Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.<br><br>Chorus<br>Anywhere, anywhere, fear I cannot know,<br>Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.<br><br><br>
