Down from the glory the Saviour came,<br>Down to the cross and the death of shame;<br>Gazing in wonder I there exclaim,<br>Jesus died for me.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus died for me; Jesus died for me;<br>This is my boast, and this my song,<br>Jesus died for me.<br><br>There as my Surety He firmly stood,<br>Paid for my ransom His precious blood;<br>Died for my sin, to bring me to God,<br>Jesus died for me.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus died for me; Jesus died for me;<br>This is my boast, and this my song,<br>Jesus died for me.<br><br>Now in the Gospel He sends to thee<br>News of salvation, and pardon free;<br>Whoso believeth, his song shall be<br>Jesus died for me.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus died for me; Jesus died for me;<br>This is my boast, and this my song,<br>Jesus died for me.<br><br><br>
