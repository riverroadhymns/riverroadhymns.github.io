Some day the silver cord will break,<br>And I no more as now shall sing:<br>But O, the joy when I shall wake<br>Within the palace of the King!<br><br>Chorus<br>And I shall see Him face to face,<br>And tell the story - saved by grace;<br>And I shall see Him face to face,<br>And tell the story - saved by grace.<br><br>Some day my earthly house will fall,<br>I cannot tell how soon 'twill be;<br>But this I know - my All-in-All<br>Has now a place in heaven for me.<br><br>Chorus<br>And I shall see Him face to face,<br>And tell the story - saved by grace;<br>And I shall see Him face to face,<br>And tell the story - saved by grace.<br><br>Some day, when fades the golden sun<br>Beneath the rosy-tinted west,<br>My blessed Lord will say, "Well done!"<br>And I shall enter into rest.<br><br>Chorus<br>And I shall see Him face to face,<br>And tell the story - saved by grace;<br>And I shall see Him face to face,<br>And tell the story - saved by grace.<br><br>Some day - till then I'll watch and wait,<br>My lamp all trimmed and burning bright,<br>And when my Saviour opes the gate,<br>I'll rise with joy and take my flight.<br><br>Chorus<br>And I shall see Him face to face,<br>And tell the story - saved by grace;<br>And I shall see Him face to face,<br>And tell the story - saved by grace.<br><br><br>
