Out in the highways and byways of life,<br>Many are weary and sad;<br>Carry the sunshine where darkness is rife,<br>Making the sorrowing glad.<br><br>Chorus<br>Make me a blessing,<br>Make me a blessing,<br>Out of my life may Jesus shine;<br>Make me a blessing, O Saviour; I pray,<br>Make me a blessing to someone today.<br><br>Tell the sweet story of Christ and His love,<br>Tell of His power to forgive;<br>Others will trust Him if only you prove<br>True, every moment you live.<br><br>Chorus<br>Make me a blessing,<br>Make me a blessing,<br>Out of my life may Jesus shine;<br>Make me a blessing, O Saviour; I pray,<br>Make me a blessing to someone today.<br><br>Give as 'twas given to you in your need,<br>Love as the Master loved you;<br>Be to the helpless a helper indeed,<br>Unto your mission be true.<br><br>Chorus<br>Make me a blessing,<br>Make me a blessing,<br>Out of my life may Jesus shine;<br>Make me a blessing, O Saviour; I pray,<br>Make me a blessing to someone today.<br><br><br>
