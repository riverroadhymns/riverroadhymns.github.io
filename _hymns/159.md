Accept His mercy:<br>He is waiting - come tonight.<br><br>Chorus<br>O be saved, His grace free!<br>O be saved He died for thee!<br>O be saved He died for thee!<br><br>Let the angels bear the tidings<br>Upward to the courts of heaven,<br>Let them sing with holy rapture,<br>O'er another soul forgiven!<br><br>Chorus<br>O be saved, His grace free!<br>O be saved He died for thee!<br>O be saved He died for thee!<br><br><br>
