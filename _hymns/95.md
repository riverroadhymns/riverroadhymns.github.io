Look to Jesus, weary one;<br>Look and live! Look and live!<br>Look at what the Lord has done,<br>Look and live!<br>See Him lifted on the tree,<br>Look and live! Look and live!<br>Hear Him say, "Look unto Me,"<br>Look and live!<br><br>Chorus<br>Look, the Lord is lifted high,<br>Look to Him, He's ever nigh,<br>Look and live! Why will ye die<br>Look and live!<br><br>Though unworthy, vile, unclean,<br>Look and live! Look and live!<br>Look away from self and sin,<br>Look and live!<br>Long by Satan's power enslaved,<br>Look and live! Look and live!<br>Look to Me, ye shall be saved.<br>Look and live!<br><br>Chorus<br>Look, the Lord is lifted high,<br>Look to Him, He's ever nigh,<br>Look and live! Why will ye die<br>Look and live!<br><br>Though you've wandered far away,<br>Look and live! Look and live!<br>Harden not you heart today,<br>Look and live!<br>Tis the Father calls thee home,<br>Look and live! Look and live!<br>Whosoever will, may come.<br>Look and live!<br><br>Chorus<br>Look, the Lord is lifted high,<br>Look to Him, He's ever nigh,<br>Look and live! Why will ye die<br>Look and live!<br><br><br>
