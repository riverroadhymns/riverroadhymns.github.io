O soul, are you weary and troubled?<br>No light in the darkness you see?<br>There's light for a look at the Saviour,<br>And life more abundant and free!<br><br>Chorus<br>Turn your eyes upon Jesus,<br>Look full in His wonderful face;<br>And the things of earth will grow strangely dim<br>In the light of His glory and grace.<br><br>Through death into life everlasting<br>He passed, and we follow Him there;<br>O'er us sin no more hath dominion<br>For more than conquerors we are!<br><br>Chorus<br>Turn your eyes upon Jesus,<br>Look full in His wonderful face;<br>And the things of earth will grow strangely dim<br>In the light of His glory and grace.<br><br>His Word shall not fail you - He promised;<br>Believe Him, and all will be well:<br>Then go to a world that is dying,<br>His perfect salvation to tell!<br><br>Chorus<br>Turn your eyes upon Jesus,<br>Look full in His wonderful face;<br>And the things of earth will grow strangely dim<br>In the light of His glory and grace.<br><br><br>
