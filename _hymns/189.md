There is no love like the love of Jesus,<br>Never to fade or fall,<br>Till into the fold of the peace of God<br>He has gathered us all.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus' love, precious love,<br>Boundless and pure and free;<br>O, turn to that love, weary wandering soul,<br>Jesus pleadeth with thee!<br><br>There is no heart like the heart of Jesus,<br>Filled with a tender love;<br>No throb nor throe that our hearts can know<br>But He feels it above.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus' love, precious love,<br>Boundless and pure and free;<br>O, turn to that love, weary wandering soul,<br>Jesus pleadeth with thee!<br><br>O let us hark to the voice of Jesus!<br>O, may we never roam,<br>Till safe we rest on His loving breast<br>In the dear heavenly home.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus' love, precious love,<br>Boundless and pure and free;<br>O, turn to that love, weary wandering soul,<br>Jesus pleadeth with thee!<br><br><br>
