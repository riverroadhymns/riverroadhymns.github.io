Naught have I gotten but what I received;<br>Grace hath bestowed it since I have believed;<br>Boasting excluded, pride I abase;<br>I'm only a sinner saved by grace!<br><br>Chorus<br>Only a sinner saved by grace!<br>Only a sinner saved by grace!<br>This is my story to God be the glory,<br>I'm only a sinner saved by grace.<br><br>Once I was foolish, and sin ruled my heart,<br>Causing my footsteps from God to depart;<br>Jesus has found me, happy my case,<br>I now am a sinner saved by grace!<br><br>Chorus<br>Only a sinner saved by grace!<br>Only a sinner saved by grace!<br>This is my story to God be the glory,<br>I'm only a sinner saved by grace.<br><br>Tears unavailing, no merit had I;<br>Mercy had saved me, or else I must die;<br>Sin had alarmed me, fearing God's face;<br>But now I'm a sinner saved by grace!<br><br>Chorus<br>Only a sinner saved by grace!<br>Only a sinner saved by grace!<br>This is my story to God be the glory,<br>I'm only a sinner saved by grace.<br><br><br>
