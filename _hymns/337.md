Saviour, more than life to me,<br>I am clinging, clinging close to Thee;<br>Let Thy precious blood applied,<br>Keep me ever, ever near Thy side.<br><br>Chorus<br>Every day, every hour,<br>Let me feel Thy cleansing power;<br>May Thy tender love to me,<br>Bind me closer; closer; Lord, to Thee.<br><br>Through this changing world below,<br>Lead me gently, gently as I go;<br>Trusting Thee, I cannot stray,<br>I can never, never, lose my way.<br><br>Chorus<br>Every day, every hour,<br>Let me feel Thy cleansing power;<br>May Thy tender love to me,<br>Bind me closer; closer; Lord, to Thee.<br><br>Let me love Thee more and more,<br>Till this fleeting, fleeting life is o'er;<br>Till my soul is lost in love<br>In a brighter, brighter world above.<br><br>Chorus<br>Every day, every hour,<br>Let me feel Thy cleansing power;<br>May Thy tender love to me,<br>Bind me closer; closer; Lord, to Thee.<br><br><br>
