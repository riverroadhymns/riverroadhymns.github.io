Jesus! Saviour! Precious name<br>Of the Son of God, Who came<br>Ruined sinners to reclaim!<br>Hallelujah! what a Saviour!<br><br>Leaving scenes of purest light,<br>Veiling glory fair and bright,<br>Cross of Christ, O, wondrous sight!<br>Hallelujah! what a Saviour!<br><br>Lost and in our sins were we;<br>Spotless, sinless, holy, He,<br>Bearing guilt upon the tree!<br>Hallelujah! what a Saviour!<br><br>Bruised in the sinner's stead,<br>E'en to death He bowed His head;<br>"It is finished!" loudly said,<br>Hallelujah! what a Saviour!<br><br>Him as Lord we gladly own<br>Seated on His Father's throne;<br>Soon we'll sing in sweeter tone,<br>Hallelujah! what a Saviour!<br><br><br>
