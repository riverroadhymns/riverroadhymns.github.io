I once was a stranger<br>To grace and to God,<br>I knew not my danger<br>And felt not my load;<br>Though friends spoke in rapture<br>Of Christ on the tree,<br>Jehovah Tsidkenu<br>Was nothing to me.<br><br>Like tears from the daughters<br>Of Zion that roll,<br>I wept when the waters<br>Went over His soul;<br>Yet thought not that my sins<br>Had nailed to the tree,<br>Jehovah Tsidkenu<br>Twas nothing to me.<br><br>When free grace awoke me<br>By light from on high,<br>Then legal fears shook me,<br>I trembled to die;<br>No refuge, no safety,<br>In self could I see,<br>Jehovah Tsidkenu,<br>My Saviour must be.<br><br>My terrors all vanished<br>Before the sweet name,<br>My guilty fears banished,<br>With boldness I came<br>To drink at the fountain,<br>Life-giving and free,<br>Jehovah Tsidkenu<br>Is all things to me.<br><br>E'en treading the valley,<br>The shadow of death,<br>This watchword will rally<br>My faltering breath;<br>For if from life's fever<br>My God sets me free,<br>Jehovah Tsidkenu,<br>My death-song shall be.<br><br><br>
