My God, I have found the thrice blessed ground,<br>Where life and where joy and true comfort abound.<br><br>Chorus<br>Hallelujah! Thine the glory,<br>Hallelujah, Amen.<br>Hallelujah! Thine the glory,<br>Revive us again.<br><br>Tis found in the blood of Him who once stood<br>My refuge and safety, my surety with God.<br><br>Chorus<br>Hallelujah! Thine the glory,<br>Hallelujah, Amen.<br>Hallelujah! Thine the glory,<br>Revive us again.<br><br>He bore on the tree the sentence for me,<br>And now both the surety and sinner are free.<br><br>Chorus<br>Hallelujah! Thine the glory,<br>Hallelujah, Amen.<br>Hallelujah! Thine the glory,<br>Revive us again.<br><br>Accepted I am in the once-offered Lamb;<br>It was God who Himself had devised the plan.<br><br>Chorus<br>Hallelujah! Thine the glory,<br>Hallelujah, Amen.<br>Hallelujah! Thine the glory,<br>Revive us again.<br><br>And though here below, 'mid sorrow and woe,<br>My place is in heaven with Jesus I know.<br><br>Chorus<br>Hallelujah! Thine the glory,<br>Hallelujah, Amen.<br>Hallelujah! Thine the glory,<br>Revive us again.<br><br>And this I shall find, for such is His mind,<br>He'll not be in glory and leave me behind.<br><br>Chorus<br>Hallelujah! Thine the glory,<br>Hallelujah, Amen.<br>Hallelujah! Thine the glory,<br>Revive us again.<br><br><br>
