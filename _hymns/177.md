The love of God is righteous love<br>Inscribed upon Golgotha's tree,<br>Love that exacts the sinners debt.<br>Yet in exacting sets him free.<br><br>Chorus<br>O wondrous love for sinners given,<br>To save from hell and bring to heaven.<br>O tell the virtues all abroad<br>Of love divine - the love of God.<br><br>Love that condemns the sinner's sin,<br>Yet in condemning, pardon seals;<br>That saves from righteous wrath, and yet<br>In saving, righteousness reveals.<br><br>Chorus<br>O wondrous love for sinners given,<br>To save from hell and bring to heaven.<br>O tell the virtues all abroad<br>Of love divine - the love of God.<br><br>This is the love that stills my fears,<br>That soothes each conscious pang within,<br>That pacifies my troubled heart<br>And frees me from the power of sin.<br><br>Chorus<br>O wondrous love for sinners given,<br>To save from hell and bring to heaven.<br>O tell the virtues all abroad<br>Of love divine - the love of God.<br><br><br>
