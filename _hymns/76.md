I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus<br>Since I found in Him a friend so strong and true;<br>I would tell you how He changed my life completely,<br>He did something that no other friend could do.<br><br>Chorus<br>No one ever cared for me like Jesus,<br>There's no other friend so kind as He;<br>No one else could take the sin and darkness from me,<br>O how much He cared for me.<br><br>All my life was full of sin when Jesus found me.<br>All my heart was full of misery and woe;<br>Jesus placed His strong and loving arms around me<br>And He led me in the way I ought to go.<br><br>Chorus<br>No one ever cared for me like Jesus,<br>There's no other friend so kind as He;<br>No one else could take the sin and darkness from me,<br>O how much He cared for me.<br><br>Every day He comes to me with new assurance,<br>More and more I understand His words of love;<br>But I'll never know just why He came to save me<br>Till some day I see His blessed face above.<br><br>Chorus<br>No one ever cared for me like Jesus,<br>There's no other friend so kind as He;<br>No one else could take the sin and darkness from me,<br>O how much He cared for me.<br><br><br>
