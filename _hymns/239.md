Years I spent in vanity and pride,<br>Caring not my Lord was crucified;<br>Knowing not it was for me He died<br>On Calvary.<br><br>Chorus<br>Mercy there was great and grace was free,<br>Pardon there was multiplied to me,<br>There my burdened soul found liberty,<br>At Calvary.<br><br>By God's Word at last my sin I learned,<br>Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned,<br>Till my guilty soul, imploring, turned<br>To Calvary.<br><br>Chorus<br>Mercy there was great and grace was free,<br>Pardon there was multiplied to me,<br>There my burdened soul found liberty,<br>At Calvary.<br><br>O, the love that drew salvation's plan,<br>O, the grace that brought it down to man,<br>O, the mighty gulf that God did span<br>At Calvary.<br><br>Chorus<br>Mercy there was great and grace was free,<br>Pardon there was multiplied to me,<br>There my burdened soul found liberty,<br>At Calvary.<br><br>Now I'd give to Jesus everything,<br>Now I gladly own Him as my King,<br>Now my raptured soul can only sing<br>Of Calvary.<br><br>Chorus<br>Mercy there was great and grace was free,<br>Pardon there was multiplied to me,<br>There my burdened soul found liberty,<br>At Calvary.<br><br><br>
