Sinners, whither will you wander<br>Whither will you stray<br>O, remember life is slender!<br>Tis but a short day.<br><br>Chorus<br>Death is coming, coming, coming<br>And the judgment day;<br>Hasten sinner; hasten sinner;<br>Seek the narrow way<br><br>Satan has resolved to have you<br>For his lawful prey;<br>Jesus Christ has died to save you;<br>Haste, O, haste away!<br><br>Chorus<br>Death is coming, coming, coming<br>And the judgment day;<br>Hasten sinner; hasten sinner;<br>Seek the narrow way<br><br>Listen to the invitation,<br>Whilst He's crying "Come!"<br>If you miss the great salvation,<br>Hell will be your doom.<br><br>Chorus<br>Death is coming, coming, coming<br>And the judgment day;<br>Hasten sinner; hasten sinner;<br>Seek the narrow way<br><br>Would you 'scape the awful sentence,<br>From destruction flee<br>Seek the Lord by true repentance,<br>Haste to Calvary.<br><br>Chorus<br>Death is coming, coming, coming<br>And the judgment day;<br>Hasten sinner; hasten sinner;<br>Seek the narrow way<br><br><br>
