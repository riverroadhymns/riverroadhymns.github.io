There's a voice that is calling to thee,<br>And it pleads with its tenderest tone,<br>While it bids thee from God's wrath to flee,<br>And whispers, "To Jesus now come!"<br><br>Chorus<br>Sinner, hear and obey,<br>Tis the voice of the Spirit that cries;<br>While He strives, yield to Him,<br>Do not quench the convictions that rise.<br><br>There's a Saviour now waiting for thee,<br>With His heart and His arms open wide;<br>Will you come, and from judgment be free<br>Through the Lamb who on Calvary died?<br><br>Chorus<br>Sinner, hear and obey,<br>Tis the voice of the Spirit that cries;<br>While He strives, yield to Him,<br>Do not quench the convictions that rise.<br><br>There's a fountain that's open for thee,<br>Go wash then, be clean from thy sin:<br>Not a spot nor a stain shall there be<br>If but once thou art cleansed therein.<br><br>Chorus<br>Sinner, hear and obey,<br>Tis the voice of the Spirit that cries;<br>While He strives, yield to Him,<br>Do not quench the convictions that rise.<br><br>There's a mansion preparing for thee;<br>With its pleasures that none can conceive:<br>And eternally happy thou'lt be,<br>If thou wilt but on Jesus believe.<br><br>Chorus<br>Sinner, hear and obey,<br>Tis the voice of the Spirit that cries;<br>While He strives, yield to Him,<br>Do not quench the convictions that rise.<br><br><br>
