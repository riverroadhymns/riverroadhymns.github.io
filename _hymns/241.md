A debtor to mercy alone,<br>Of covenant mercy I sing,<br>Nor fear, with God's righteousness on,<br>My person and offerings to bring.<br>The terrors of law and of God<br>With me can have nothing to do;<br>My Saviour's obedience and blood<br>Hide all my transgressions from view.<br><br>The work which His goodness began,<br>The arm of His strength will complete;<br>His promise is Yea and Amen,<br>And never was forfeited yet.<br>Things future, nor things that are now,<br>Not all things below or above,<br>Can make Him His purpose forego,<br>Or sever my soul from His love.<br><br>My name from the palms of His hands<br>Eternity will not erase!<br>Impressed on His heart, it remains<br>In marks of indelible grace.<br>Yes! I to the end shall endure,<br>As sure as the earnest is given;<br>More happy, but not more secure,<br>The souls of the blessed in heaven.<br><br><br>
