There have been names that I have loved to hear,<br>But never has there been a name so dear<br>To this heart of mine, as the name divine,<br>The precious, precious name of Jesus.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus is the sweetest name I know,<br>And He's just the same as His lovely name,<br>And that's the reason why I love Him so;<br>For Jesus is the sweetest name I know.<br><br>There is no name in earth or heaven above,<br>That we should give such honour and such love<br>As the blessed name, let us all acclaim,<br>That wondrous, glorious name of Jesus.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus is the sweetest name I know,<br>And He's just the same as His lovely name,<br>And that's the reason why I love Him so;<br>For Jesus is the sweetest name I know.<br><br>And some day I shall see Him face to face<br>To thank and praise Him for His wondrous grace,<br>Which He gave to me, when He made me free,<br>The blessed Son of God called Jesus.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus is the sweetest name I know,<br>And He's just the same as His lovely name,<br>And that's the reason why I love Him so;<br>For Jesus is the sweetest name I know.<br><br><br>
