Say, poor sinner, take salvation,<br>Jesus died to set you right,<br>Do not give the dreadful answer,<br>"I'll be saved, but not tonight.<br>Give me just a little longer,<br>For the world looks now so bright,<br>When I feel that I am dying,<br>I'll be saved, but not tonight,"<br><br>When the judgment overtakes you<br>And those words appear in sight.<br>How they prayed and pleaded with you<br>But you answered, "Not tonight."<br>This will be the time, poor sinner,<br>When you stand on death's cold brink,<br>When your soul is lost forever,<br>Without Christ you're sure to sink.<br><br>O, how vain is the delusion<br>That the Lord your time will wait.<br>Millions now are lost forever,<br>Just outside the golden gate.<br>Once like you the Saviour bade them<br>Enter into glorious light,<br>But like you they softly answered,<br>"I'll be saved, but not tonight."<br><br>Listen, sinner, to the Saviour,<br>Pleading with the erring one,<br>Listen to His kind entreaties,<br>Come, ye weary wanderer, come.<br>List no longer to the tempter,<br>To the world the words seem bright,<br>Answer Jesus, gladly saying,<br>"I'll be saved, yes, saved tonight."<br><br><br>
