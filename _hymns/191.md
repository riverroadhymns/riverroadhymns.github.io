There was One who was willing to die in my stead,<br>That a soul so unworthy might live,<br>And the path to the cross He was willing to tread,<br>All the sins of my life to forgive.<br><br>Chorus<br>He was nailed to the cross,<br>He was nailed to the cross,<br>O how much He was willing to bear!<br>With what anguish and loss,<br>Jesus went to the cross!<br>And my sins were all laid on Him there!<br><br>He is tender and loving and patient with me,<br>While He cleanses my heart of its dross,<br>But there's no condemnation - I know I am free,<br>For my sins are all nailed to the cross.<br><br>Chorus<br>He was nailed to the cross,<br>He was nailed to the cross,<br>O how much He was willing to bear!<br>With what anguish and loss,<br>Jesus went to the cross!<br>And my sins were all laid on Him there!<br><br>I will cling to my Saviour and never depart,<br>I will joyfully journey each day<br>With a song on my lips and a song in my heart,<br>That my sins have been taken away.<br><br>Chorus<br>He was nailed to the cross,<br>He was nailed to the cross,<br>O how much He was willing to bear!<br>With what anguish and loss,<br>Jesus went to the cross!<br>And my sins were all laid on Him there!<br><br><br>
