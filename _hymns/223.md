When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,<br>When sorrows like sea-billows roll;<br>Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to know,<br>It is well, it is well with my soul.<br><br>Chorus<br>It is well with my soul,<br>It is well, it is well with my soul.<br><br>Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,<br>Let this blest assurance control,<br>That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate<br>And hath shed His own blood for my soul.<br><br>Chorus<br>It is well with my soul,<br>It is well, it is well with my soul.<br><br>My sin, O, the bliss of this glorious thought,<br>My sin, not in part, but the whole,<br>Is nailed to His cross and I bear it no more;<br>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!<br><br>Chorus<br>It is well with my soul,<br>It is well, it is well with my soul.<br><br>For me be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live;<br>If death's waters o'er me shall roll,<br>No pang shall be mine for in death, as in life,<br>Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.<br><br>Chorus<br>It is well with my soul,<br>It is well, it is well with my soul.<br><br>But, Lord 'tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,<br>The sky, not the grave, is our goal;<br>O, trump of the angel! O, voice of the Lord!<br>Blessed hope! blessed rest of my soul!<br><br>Chorus<br>It is well with my soul,<br>It is well, it is well with my soul.<br><br><br>
