The love of God is greater far<br>Than tongue or pen can ever tell;<br>It goes beyond the highest star,<br>And reaches where all mortals dwell;<br>The guilty pair, bowed down with care,<br>God gave His Son to win;<br>His erring child He reconciled,<br>And pardoned from his sin.<br><br>Chorus<br>O love of God, how rich and pure!<br>How measureless and strong!<br>It shall for evermore endure,<br>The saints' and angels' song.<br><br>When hoary time shall pass away,<br>And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;<br>When men who here refuse to pray,<br>On rocks and hills and mountains call;<br>God's love, so sure, shall still endure,<br>All measureless and strong;<br>Redeeming grace to Adam's race,<br>The saints and angels song.<br><br>O love of God, how rich and pure!<br>How measureless and strong!<br>It shall for evermore endure,<br>The saints' and angels' song.<br><br>Could we with ink the ocean fill<br>And were the skies of parchment made;<br>Were every stalk on earth a quill,<br>And every man a scribe by trade;<br>To write the love of God above<br>Would drain the ocean dry;<br>Nor could the scroll contain the whole.<br>Though stretched from sky to sky.<br><br>O love of God, how rich and pure!<br>How measureless and strong!<br>It shall for evermore endure,<br>The saints' and angels' song.<br><br><br>
