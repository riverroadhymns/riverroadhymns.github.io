Salvation! O salvation!<br>Endearing, precious sound!<br>Shout, shout the word "Salvation!"<br>To earth's remotest bound.<br>Salvation for the guilty,<br>Salvation for the, lost,<br>Salvation for the wretched,<br>The sad and sorrow-tossed.<br><br>Salvation for the aged,<br>Salvation for the young,<br>Salvation e'en for children,<br>Proclaim with joyful tongue;<br>Salvation for the wealthy,<br>Salvation for the poor,<br>Salvation for the lowly,<br>E'en life for evermore.<br><br>Salvation without money,<br>Salvation without price,<br>Salvation without labour,<br>Believing doth suffice;<br>Salvation now - this moment!<br>Then why, O why delay<br>You may not see to-morrow,<br>Now is salvation's day!<br><br><br>
