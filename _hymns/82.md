Is there a heart that is waiting,<br>Longing for pardon today?<br>Hear the glad message proclaiming,<br>Jesus is passing this way.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus is passing this way,<br>This way today;<br>Jesus is passing this way,<br>Is passing this way today.<br><br>Is there a heart that has wandered?<br>Come with thy burden today;<br>Mercy is tenderly pleading,<br>Jesus is passing this way.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus is passing this way,<br>This way today;<br>Jesus is passing this way,<br>Is passing this way today.<br><br>Is there a heart that is broken,<br>Weary and sighing for rest?<br>Come to the arms of thy Saviour,<br>Pillow thy head on His breast.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus is passing this way,<br>This way today;<br>Jesus is passing this way,<br>Is passing this way today.<br><br>Come to thy only Redeemer,<br>Come to His infinite love;<br>Come to the gate that is leading<br>Homeward to mansions above.<br><br>Chorus<br>Jesus is passing this way,<br>This way today;<br>Jesus is passing this way,<br>Is passing this way today.<br><br><br>
