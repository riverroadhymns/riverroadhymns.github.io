Jesus is standing in Pilate's hall,<br>Friendless, forsaken, betrayed by all:<br>Hearken! What meaneth the sudden call,<br>"What will you do with Jesus?<br><br>Chorus<br>What will you do with Jesus?<br>Neutral you cannot be;<br>Some day your heart will be asking,<br>"What will He do with me?"<br><br>Will you evade Him as Pilate tried?<br>Or will you choose Him, whate'er betide?<br>Vainly you struggle from Him to hide:<br>What will you do with Jesus?<br><br>Chorus<br>What will you do with Jesus?<br>Neutral you cannot be;<br>Some day your heart will be asking,<br>"What will He do with me?"<br><br>Jesus is standing on trial still,<br>Yours is the choice now for good or ill,<br>Now for eternity yield your will:<br>What will you do with Jesus?<br><br>Chorus<br>What will you do with Jesus?<br>Neutral you cannot be;<br>Some day your heart will be asking,<br>"What will He do with me?"<br><br><br>
