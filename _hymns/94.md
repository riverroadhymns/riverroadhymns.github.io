Long a rebel, O my Saviour,<br>I have wandered far from Thee;<br>Now I hear of boundless favour,<br>Bringing pardon unto me.<br><br>Chorus<br>I surrender; I surrender;<br>Overcome by love divine;<br>Thee as Saviour and Defender<br>I accept, and I am Thine.<br><br>Oft' I've heard the matchless story<br>Of Thy death upon the tree;<br>Now I see its beams of glory,<br>For I know it was for me.<br><br>Chorus<br>I surrender; I surrender;<br>Overcome by love divine;<br>Thee as Saviour and Defender<br>I accept, and I am Thine.<br><br>I Long my weary feet have hasted<br>In the path that leads from Thee;<br>Now, when years, alas! are wasted,<br>I surrender, Lord, to Thee.<br><br>Chorus<br>I surrender; I surrender;<br>Overcome by love divine;<br>Thee as Saviour and Defender<br>I accept, and I am Thine.<br><br>Thou for me didst come from heaven,<br>Died upon the cross of shame;<br>Thou eternal life hast given,<br>Glory be unto Thy name!<br><br>Chorus<br>I surrender; I surrender;<br>Overcome by love divine;<br>Thee as Saviour and Defender<br>I accept, and I am Thine.<br><br><br>
