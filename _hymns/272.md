There's One above all earthly friends<br>Whose love all earthly love transcends,<br>It is my Lord and Christ divine,<br>My Lord, because I know He's mine,<br><br>Chorus<br>I know He's mine. this Friend so dear,<br>He lives with me, He's ever near;<br>Ten thousand charms around Him shine,<br>And, best of all, I know He's mine.<br><br>He's mine because He died for me,<br>He saved my soul, He set me free;<br>With joy I worship at His shrine,<br>And cry, "Praise God, I know He's mine."<br><br>Chorus<br>I know He's mine. this Friend so dear,<br>He lives with me, He's ever near;<br>Ten thousand charms around Him shine,<br>And, best of all, I know He's mine.<br><br>He's mine because He's in my heart,<br>And never, never will we part;<br>Just as the branch is to the vine<br>I'm joined to Christ, I know He's mine.<br><br>Chorus<br>I know He's mine. this Friend so dear,<br>He lives with me, He's ever near;<br>Ten thousand charms around Him shine,<br>And, best of all, I know He's mine.<br><br>Some day upon the street of gold<br>Mine eyes His glory shall behold,<br>Then, while His arms around me twine,<br>I'll cry for joy, "I know He's mine."<br><br>Chorus<br>I know He's mine. this Friend so dear,<br>He lives with me, He's ever near;<br>Ten thousand charms around Him shine,<br>And, best of all, I know He's mine.<br><br><br>
