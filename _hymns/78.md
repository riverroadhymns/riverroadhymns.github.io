If I gained the world, but lost the Saviour,<br>Were my life worth living for a day?<br>Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort<br>In the things that soon must pass away?<br>If I gained the world, but lost the Saviour,<br>Would my gain be worth the life-long strife?<br>Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing<br>For a moment with a Christ-filled life?<br><br>Had I wealth and love in fullest measure,<br>And a name revered both far and near,<br>Yet no hope beyond, no harbour waiting,<br>Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer;<br>If I gained the world but lost the Saviour<br>Who endured the Cross and died for me,<br>Could then all the world afford a refuge,<br>Whither, in my anguish, I might flee?<br><br>O, what emptiness without the Saviour,<br>Mid the sins and sorrows here below!<br>And eternity, how dark without Him<br>Only night and tears and endless woe!<br>What, though I might live without the Saviour,<br>When I come to die, how would it be<br>O to face the valley's gloom without Him!<br>And without Him all eternity!<br><br>O the joy of having all in Jesus!<br>What a balm the broken heart to heal!<br>Ne'er a sin so great, but He'll forgive it,<br>Nor a sorrow that He does not feel!<br>If I have but Jesus, only Jesus,<br>Nothing else in all the world beside<br>O then everything is mine in Jesus;<br>For my needs and more He will provide.<br><br><br>
