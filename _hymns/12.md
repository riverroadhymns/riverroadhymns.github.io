Behold the Man upon the throne!<br>Both Lord and Christ is He alone,<br>God sent Him forth, His only One,<br>The Father's well-beloved Son.<br><br>Jesus, God's gift from heaven came;<br>Bore on the earth reproach and shame,<br>Bowed on the cross His holy head,<br>Died, and God raised Him from the dead.<br><br>Once for our crimson sins He died,<br>He suffered, He was crucified;<br>Now He, with glory, honour crowned,<br>O'er sin makes grace much more abound.<br><br>One Mediator, throned above,<br>Bears witness God is light and love;<br>None but the Son sets sinners free,<br>"Come now," He saith, "come unto Me."<br><br>"Come unto Me!" O blessed voice!<br>Ye laden ones, make Christ your choice;<br>The hour is near when every eye<br>Shall see Him shine in yonder sky.<br><br>God doth extol none other name,<br>Supreme, eternal, is His claim;<br>His rights let all confess, obey;<br>"Come unto Me," He saith today!<br><br><br>
