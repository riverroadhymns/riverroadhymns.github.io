Where will you spend eternity?<br>This question comes to you and me!<br>Tell me, what shall your answer be,<br>Where will you spend eternity?<br>Eternity! Eternity!<br>Where will you spend Eternity?<br><br>Many are choosing Christ today,<br>Turning from all their sins away,<br>Heaven shall their blessed portion be.<br>Where will you spend eternity?<br>Eternity! Eternity!<br>Where will you spend eternity?<br><br>Passing the strait and narrow way,<br>Going the downward road today,<br>Sad will their final ending be,<br>Lost through a long eternity!<br>Eternity! Eternity!<br>Lost through a long eternity!<br><br>Turn, and believe this very hour,<br>Trust in the Saviour's grace and power;<br>Then shall your joyous answer be,<br>"Saved through a long eternity!"<br>Eternity! Eternity!<br>Saved through a long eternity.<br><br><br>
