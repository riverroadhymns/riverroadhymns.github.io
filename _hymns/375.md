Call them in! the poor, the wretched,<br>Sin-stained wanderers from the fold!<br>Peace and pardon freely offer;<br>Can you weigh their worth with gold?<br>Call them in! the weak, the weary,<br>Laden with the doom of sin;<br>Bid them come and rest in Jesus,<br>He is waiting, call them in!<br><br>Call them in! the Jew, the Gentile,<br>Bid the strangers to the feast;<br>Call them in! - the rich, the noble,<br>From the highest to the least.<br>Forth the Father runs to meet them,<br>He hath all their sorrows seen;<br>Robe and ring, and royal sandals,<br>Wait the lost ones, call them in!<br><br>Call them in! the mere professors,<br>Slumbering, sleeping on hell's brink;<br>Nought of life are they possessors,<br>Yet of safety vainly think;<br>Bring them in! the careless scoffers,<br>Pleasure-seekers of the earth;<br>Tell of God's most gracious offers,<br>And of Jesus' priceless worth.<br><br>Call them in! the broken hearted,<br>Cowering 'neath the brand of shame;<br>Speak Iove's message low and tender,<br>'Twas for sinners Jesus came.<br>See! the shadows lengthen round us,<br>Soon the day-dawn will begin;<br>Can you leave them lost and lonely?<br>Christ is coming, call them in!<br><br><br>
