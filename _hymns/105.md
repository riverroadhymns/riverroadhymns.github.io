Not what these hands have done<br>Can save this guilty soul;<br>Not what this toiling flesh has borne,<br>Can make my spirit whole.<br><br>Chorus<br>Thy work alone, my Saviour;<br>Can ease this weight of sin,<br>Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God,<br>Can give me peace within.<br><br>Not what I feel or do<br>Can give me peace with God;<br>Not all my prayers, or sighs, or tears<br>Can ease my awful load.<br><br>Chorus<br>Thy work alone, my Saviour;<br>Can ease this weight of sin,<br>Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God,<br>Can give me peace within.<br><br>Thy love to me, O God,<br>Not mine, O Lord, to Thee,<br>Can rid me of this dark unrest,<br>And set my spirit free.<br><br>Chorus<br>Thy work alone, my Saviour;<br>Can ease this weight of sin,<br>Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God,<br>Can give me peace within.<br><br>I praise the God of grace,<br>I trust His love and might;<br>He calls me His, I call Him mine,<br>My God, my joy, my light.<br><br>Chorus<br>Thy work alone, my Saviour;<br>Can ease this weight of sin,<br>Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God,<br>Can give me peace within.<br><br><br>
