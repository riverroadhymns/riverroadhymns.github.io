In my darkness Jesus found me,<br>Touched my eyes and made me see,<br>Broke sin's chain that long had bound me,<br>Gave me life and liberty!<br><br>Chorus<br>O glorious love of Christ my Lord divine<br>That made Him stoop to save a soul like mine!<br>Through all my days and then in heaven above<br>My song will silence never,<br>I'll worship Him forever<br>And praise Him for His glorious love!<br><br>O amazing truth to ponder-<br>He whom angel hosts attend,<br>Lord of heav'n, God's Son, what wonder!<br>He became the sinner's friend!<br><br>Chorus<br>O glorious love of Christ my Lord divine<br>That made Him stoop to save a soul like mine!<br>Through all my days and then in heaven above<br>My song will silence never,<br>I'll worship Him forever<br>And praise Him for His glorious love!<br><br><br>
