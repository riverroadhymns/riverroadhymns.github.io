O say, hast thou been to the Saviour,<br>Who life everlasting will give<br>He asks nothing hard of thee, sinner,<br>'Tis only to trust Him, and live!<br><br>For free as the glorious sunshine,<br>Yes, free as the light and the air,<br>Is the blessed redemption of Jesus<br>O what with His love may compare<br><br>How simple God's way of salvation!<br>Not trying or doing one's best,<br>But just in believing in Jesus<br>The weary and sinful find rest!<br><br>Proclaiming release to the captive,<br>Poor slaves of the tyrant set free,<br>The power of Satan was broken<br>When Jesus expired on the tree.<br><br>The Saviour has purchased thy freedom,<br>But priceless the ransom He gave;<br>Then trust in the blood, all atoning,<br>Of Jesus, the mighty to save.<br><br><br>
