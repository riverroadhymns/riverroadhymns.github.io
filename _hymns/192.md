There were ninety and nine that safely lay<br>In the shelter of the fold,<br>But one was out on the hills away,<br>Far off from the gates of gold,<br>Away on the mountains wild and bare,<br>Away from the tender Shepherd's care.<br><br>"Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine,<br>Are they not enough for Thee?"<br>But the Shepherd made answer,<br>"This of Mine has wandered away from Me;<br>And although the road be rough and steep,<br>I go to the desert to find My sheep."<br><br>But none of the ransomed ever knew<br>How deep were the waters crossed;<br>Nor how dark was the night that the Lord passed through<br>Ere he found His sheep that was lost.<br>Out in the desert He heard its cry,<br>Sick and helpless and ready to die.<br><br>"Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way<br>That mark out the mountain's track?"<br>"They were shed for one who had gone astray<br>Ere the Shepherd could bring him back;"<br>"Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?"<br>"They are pierced tonight by many a thorn."<br><br>And all through the mountains thunder-riven,<br>And up from the rocky steep,<br>There arose a cry to the gate of heaven,<br>"Rejoice! I have found my sheep!"<br>And the angels echoed around the throne,<br>"Rejoice! for the Lord brings back His own."<br><br><br>
