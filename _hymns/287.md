By faith the Lamb of God I see<br>Expiring on the cross for me.<br>He paid the mighty debt I owe;<br>He died because He loved me so.<br><br>Chorus<br>He loved me so, He loved me so;<br>He died because He loved me so.<br><br>For me the Father sent His Son,<br>For me the victory He won,<br>To save my soul from endless woe,<br>He died because He loved me so.<br><br>Chorus<br>He loved me so, He loved me so;<br>He died because He loved me so.<br><br>So glad I am that He is mine,<br>So glad that I with Him shall shine,<br>I'll trust in Him, for this I know,<br>He died because He loved me so.<br><br>Chorus<br>He loved me so, He loved me so;<br>He died because He loved me so.<br><br>O Lamb of God that made me free,<br>I consecrate my all to Thee.<br>My all, for this I surely know,<br>He died because He loved me so.<br><br>Chorus<br>He loved me so, He loved me so;<br>He died because He loved me so.<br><br>And when my Lord shall bid me come<br>To join the loved ones round the throne,<br>I'll sing as through the gates I go,<br>He died because He loved me so.<br><br>Chorus<br>He loved me so, He loved me so;<br>He died because He loved me so.<br><br><br>
