The day Thou gavest, Lord, is ended;<br>The darkness falls at Thy behest;<br>To Thee our morning hymns ascended,<br>Thy praise shall sanctify our rest.<br><br>We thank Thee that Thy church, unsleeping,<br>While earth rolls onward into light,<br>Through all the world her watch is keeping,<br>And rests not now by day or night.<br><br>As o'er each continent and island<br>The dawn leads on another day,<br>The voice of prayer is never silent,<br>Nor dies the strain of praise away.<br><br>The sun that bids us rest is waking<br>Our brethren 'neath the western sky,<br>And hour by hour fresh lips are making<br>Thy wondrous doings heard on high.<br><br>So be it, Lord! Thy throne shall never,<br>Like earth's proud empires, pass away;<br>Thy kingdom stands and grows for ever,<br>'Till all Thy creatures own Thy sway.<br><br><br>
