Behold Me standing at the door,<br>And hear Me pleading evermore,<br>With gentle voice, O, heart of sin,<br>May I come in? May I come in?<br><br>Chorus<br>Behold Me standing at the door,<br>And hear Me pleading evermore:<br>Say weary heart, oppressed with sin,<br>May I come in? May I come in?<br><br>I bore the cruel thorns for thee,<br>I've waited long and patiently:<br>Say, weary heart, oppressed with sin,<br>May I come in? May I come in?<br><br>Chorus<br>Behold Me standing at the door,<br>And hear Me pleading evermore:<br>Say weary heart, oppressed with sin,<br>May I come in? May I come in?<br><br>I would not plead with thee in vain;<br>Remember all My grief and pain!<br>I died, to ransom thee from sin:<br>May I come in? May I come in?<br><br>Chorus<br>Behold Me standing at the door,<br>And hear Me pleading evermore:<br>Say weary heart, oppressed with sin,<br>May I come in? May I come in?<br><br>I bring thee joy from heaven above,<br>I bring thee pardon, peace, and love:<br>Say, weary heart, oppressed with sin,<br>May I come in? May I come in?<br><br>Chorus<br>Behold Me standing at the door,<br>And hear Me pleading evermore:<br>Say weary heart, oppressed with sin,<br>May I come in? May I come in?<br><br><br>
