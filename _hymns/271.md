The King of love my Shepherd is,<br>Whose goodness faileth never;<br>I nothing lack if I am His<br>And He is mine forever.<br><br>Where streams of living water flow,<br>My ransomed soul He leadeth,<br>And, where the verdant pastures grow,<br>With food celestial feedeth.<br><br>Perverse and foolish oft I strayed<br>But yet in love He sought me<br>And on His shoulders gently laid,<br>And home rejoicing brought me.<br><br>In death's dark vale I fear no ill<br>With Thee, dear Lord, beside me;<br>Thy rod and staff my comfort still,<br>Thy cross before to guide me.<br><br>And so through all the length of days<br>Thy goodness faileth never;<br>Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise<br>Within Thy house for ever.<br><br><br>
