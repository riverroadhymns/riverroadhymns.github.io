Hark! the gospel news is sounding,<br>Christ has suffered on the tree;<br>Streams of mercy are abounding,<br>Grace for all is rich and free.<br>Now poor sinner,<br>Come to Him who died for thee.<br><br>O! escape to yonder mountain,<br>Refuge find in Him today;<br>Christ invites you to the fountain,<br>Come and wash your sins away.<br>Do not tarry,<br>Come to Jesus while you may.<br><br>Grace is flowing like a river,<br>Millions there have been supplied;<br>Still it flows as fresh as ever<br>From the Saviour's wounded side.<br>None need perish,<br>All may live, for Christ has died.<br><br>Christ alone shall be our portion,<br>Soon we hope to meet above;<br>Then we'll bathe in the full ocean<br>Of the great Redeemer's love;<br>All His fullness<br>We shall then for ever prove.<br><br><br>
