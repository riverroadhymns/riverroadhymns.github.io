O, what will you do with Jesus?<br>The call comes low and sweet;<br>And tenderly He bids you<br>Your burden lay at His feet.<br>O soul so sad and weary,<br>That sweet voice speaks to thee,<br>Then what will you do with Jesus?<br>O, what shall the answer be?<br><br>Chorus<br>What shall the answer be?<br>What shall the answer be?<br>What will you do with Jesus?<br>O, what shall the answer be?<br><br>O, what will you do with Jesus?<br>The call comes low and clear;<br>The solemn words are sounding<br>In every listening ear.<br>Eternal life's in the question<br>And joy through eternity.<br>Then what will you do with Jesus?<br>O, what shall the answer be?<br><br><br>
