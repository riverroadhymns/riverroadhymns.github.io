This world is a wilderness wide,<br>I have nothing to seek or to choose;<br>I've no thought in the waste to abide,<br>I have nought to regret nor to lose.<br><br>The path where my Saviour is gone<br>Has led up to His Father and God,<br>To the place where He's now on the throne<br>And His strength shall be mine on the road.<br><br>With Him shall my rest be on high,<br>When in holiness bright I sit down<br>In the joy of His love ever nigh,<br>In the peace that His presence shall crown.<br><br>'Tis the treasure I've found in His love<br>That has made me a pilgrim below;<br>And 'tis there, when I reach Him above,<br>As I'm known, all His fullness I'll know.<br><br>And Saviour, 'tis Thou from on high<br>I await till the time Thou shalt come,<br>To take him Thou hast led by Thine eye<br>To Thyself in Thy heavenly home.<br><br>Till then 'tis the path Thou hast trod,<br>My delight and my comfort shall be;<br>I'm content with Thy staff and Thy rod<br>Till with Thee all Thy glory I see.<br><br><br>
