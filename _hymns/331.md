One there is above all others,<br>O, how He loves!<br>His is love beyond a brother's<br>O, how He loves!<br>Earthly friends may fail and leave us,<br>One day soothe, the next day grieve us,<br>But this Friend will ne'er deceive us,<br>O, how He loves!<br><br>Tis eternal life to know Him,<br>O, how He loves!<br>Think, O think how much We owe Him,<br>O, how He loves!<br>With His precious blood He bought us,<br>In the wilderness He sought us,<br>To His fold He safely brought us,<br>O, how He loves!<br><br>We have found a friend in Jesus,<br>O, how He loves!<br>Tis His great delight to bless us,<br>O, how He loves!<br>How our hearts delight to hear Him,<br>Bid us dwell in safety near Him!<br>Why should we distrust or fear Him?<br>O, how He loves!<br><br>Through His Name we are forgiven,<br>O, how He loves!<br>Backward shall our foes be driven,<br>O, how He loves!<br>Best of blessings He'll provide us,<br>Nought but good shall e'er betide us,<br>Safe to glory He will guide us,<br>O, how He loves!<br><br><br>
