O happy day that fixed my choice<br>On Thee, my Saviour and my God,<br>Well may this glowing heart rejoice,<br>And tell its raptures all abroad.<br><br>Chorus<br>Happy day! Happy day!<br>When Jesus washed my sins away.<br>He taught me how to watch and pray,<br>And live rejoicing every day.<br>Happy day! Happy day!<br>When Jesus washed my sins away.<br><br>'Tis done - the great transactions done;<br>I am my Lord's, and He is mine;<br>He drew me and I followed on,<br>Charmed to confess the voice Divine.<br><br>Chorus<br>Happy day! Happy day!<br>When Jesus washed my sins away.<br>He taught me how to watch and pray,<br>And live rejoicing every day.<br>Happy day! Happy day!<br>When Jesus washed my sins away.<br><br>Now rest, my long-divided heart,<br>Fixed on this blissful centre, rest;<br>Nor ever from my Lord depart,<br>With Him of every good possessed.<br><br>Chorus<br>Happy day! Happy day!<br>When Jesus washed my sins away.<br>He taught me how to watch and pray,<br>And live rejoicing every day.<br>Happy day! Happy day!<br>When Jesus washed my sins away.<br><br><br>
