Does Jesus care when my heart is pained<br>Too deeply for mirth or song;<br>As the burdens press, and the cares distress,<br>And the way grows weary and long?<br><br>Chorus<br>O, yes, He cares; I know He cares,<br>His heart is touched with my grief<br>When the days are weary,<br>The long nights dreary,<br>I know my Saviour cares.<br><br>Does Jesus care when my way is dark<br>With a nameless dread and fear?<br>As the daylight fades into deep night shades,<br>Does He care enough to be near?<br><br>Chorus<br>O, yes, He cares; I know He cares,<br>His heart is touched with my grief<br>When the days are weary,<br>The long nights dreary,<br>I know my Saviour cares.<br><br>Does Jesus care when I've said "good-bye"<br>To the dearest on earth to me,<br>And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks,<br>Is this aught to Him? Does He see?<br><br>Chorus<br>O, yes, He cares; I know He cares,<br>His heart is touched with my grief<br>When the days are weary,<br>The long nights dreary,<br>I know my Saviour cares.<br><br><br>
