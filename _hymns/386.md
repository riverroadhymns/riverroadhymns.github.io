Lord, speak to me, that I may speak<br>In living echoes of Thy tone;<br>As Thou hast sought, so let me seek<br>Thy erring children, lost and lone.<br><br>O lead me, Lord, that I may lead<br>The wandering and the wavering feet;<br>O feed me, Lord, that I may feed<br>Thy hungering ones with manna sweet.<br><br>O teach me, Lord, that I may teach<br>The precious things Thou dost impart;<br>And wing my words that they may reach<br>The hidden depths of many a heart.<br><br>O fill me with Thy fullness, Lord,<br>Until my very heart o'erflow<br>In kindling thought and glowing word,<br>Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.<br><br>O use me, Lord, use even me,<br>Just as Thou wilt, and when, and where,<br>Until Thy blessed face I see;<br>Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.<br><br><br>
