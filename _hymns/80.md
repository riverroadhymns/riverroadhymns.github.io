In loving kindness Jesus came,<br>My soul in mercy to reclaim,<br>And from the depths of sin and shame<br>Through grace He lifted me.<br><br>Chorus<br>From sinking sand He lifted me;<br>With tender hand He lifted me;<br>From shades of night to plains of light,<br>O, praise His name, He lifted me!<br><br>He called me long before I heard,<br>Before my sinful heart was stirred;<br>But when I took Him at His word,<br>Forgiven He lifted me.<br><br>Chorus<br>From sinking sand He lifted me;<br>With tender hand He lifted me;<br>From shades of night to plains of light,<br>O, praise His name, He lifted me!<br><br>His-brow was pierced with many a thorn,<br>His hands by cruel nails were torn,<br>When from my guilt and grief, forlorn,<br>In love He lifted me.<br><br>Chorus<br>From sinking sand He lifted me;<br>With tender hand He lifted me;<br>From shades of night to plains of light,<br>O, praise His name, He lifted me!<br><br>Now on a higher plane I dwell,<br>And with my soul I know 'tis well;<br>Yet how or why, I cannot tell,<br>He should have lifted me.<br><br>Chorus<br>From sinking sand He lifted me;<br>With tender hand He lifted me;<br>From shades of night to plains of light,<br>O, praise His name, He lifted me!<br><br><br>
