Satisfied with Thee, Lord Jesus, I am blest,<br>Peace which passeth understanding on Thy breast,<br>No more doubting, no more trembling,<br>No more trembling, O, what rest.<br><br>Occupied with Thee, Lord Jesus, in Thy grace,<br>All Thy ways and thoughts about me, only trace<br>Deeper stories of the glories,<br>Of the glories, of Thy grace.<br><br>Taken up with Thee, Lord Jesus, I would be<br>Finding joy and satisfaction all in Thee.<br>Thou the nearest and the dearest,<br>And the dearest, unto me.<br><br>Listening for Thy shout, Lord Jesus, in the air,<br>When Thy saints shall rise with joy to meet Thee there.<br>O what gladness, No more sadness!<br>No more sadness, sin nor care.<br><br>When Thy blood-bought church, Lord Jesus, is complete;<br>When each soul is safely landed. at Thy feet;<br>What a story, in the glory,<br>In the glory, she'll repeat!<br><br>O to praise Thee there, Lord Jesus, evermore!<br>O to grieve and wander from Thee nevermore!<br>Earth's sad story closed in glory,<br>Closed in glory, on yon shore!<br><br><br>
