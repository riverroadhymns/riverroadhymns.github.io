Tis the promise of God full salvation to give<br>Unto all who on Jesus, His Son, will believe.<br><br>Chorus<br>Hallelujah! 'tis done,<br>I believe on the Son,<br>I am saved by the blood<br>Of the crucified One.<br><br>Though the pathway be lonely and dangerous too,<br>Surely Jesus is able to carry me through.<br><br>Chorus<br>Hallelujah! 'tis done,<br>I believe on the Son,<br>I am saved by the blood<br>Of the crucified One.<br><br>Many loved ones have I in yon heavenly throng,<br>They are safe now in glory and this is their song.<br><br>Chorus<br>Hallelujah! 'tis done,<br>I believe on the Son,<br>I am saved by the blood<br>Of the crucified One.<br><br>There's a part in that chorus for you and for me,<br>And the theme of our praises for ever will be.<br><br>Chorus<br>Hallelujah! 'tis done,<br>I believe on the Son,<br>I am saved by the blood<br>Of the crucified One.<br><br><br>
