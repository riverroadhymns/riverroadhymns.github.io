Jesus, keep me near the cross,<br>There a precious fountain,<br>Free to all, a healing stream<br>Flows from Calvary's mountain.<br><br>Chorus<br>In the cross, in the cross,<br>Be my glory ever;<br>Till my ruptured soul shall find<br>Rest beyond the river.<br><br>Near the cross, a trembling soul,<br>Love and mercy found me;<br>There the Bright and Morning Star<br>Shed His beams around me.<br><br>Chorus<br>In the cross, in the cross,<br>Be my glory ever;<br>Till my ruptured soul shall find<br>Rest beyond the river.<br><br>Near the cross, O Lamb of God,<br>Bring its scenes before me;<br>Help me walk from day to day,<br>With its shadow o'er me.<br><br>Chorus<br>In the cross, in the cross,<br>Be my glory ever;<br>Till my ruptured soul shall find<br>Rest beyond the river.<br><br>Near the cross, I'll watch and wait,<br>Hoping, trusting ever,<br>Till I reach the golden strand,<br>Just beyond the river.<br><br>Chorus<br>In the cross, in the cross,<br>Be my glory ever;<br>Till my ruptured soul shall find<br>Rest beyond the river.<br><br><br>
