I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,<br>Trusting only Thee!<br>Trusting Thee for full salvation,<br>Great and free.<br><br>I am trusting Thee for pardon,<br>At Thy feet I bow;<br>For Thy grace and tender mercy,<br>Trusting now.<br><br>I am trusting Thee for cleansing<br>In Thy precious blood;<br>Trusting Thee to bring me safely<br>Home to God.<br><br>I am trusting Thee to guide me,<br>Thou alone shalt lead;<br>Every day and hour supplying<br>All my need.<br><br>I am trusting thee, Lord Jesus;<br>On Thy name I call;<br>I am trusting Thee for ever,<br>And for all.<br><br><br>
