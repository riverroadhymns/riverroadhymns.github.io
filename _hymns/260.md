Let us now retrace the pathway<br>Of the Blessed Son of God,<br>Pondering, with adoration,<br>All the way that He has trod,<br>See Him in the lowly manger,<br>Hear Him on the mountainside,<br>Wheresoe'er His feet have traversed,<br>There with love would we abide.<br><br>Brightly through the moral darkness<br>Shone the radiance of His grace,<br>As the Spirit marked Him out as<br>Fairest of the earth-born race,<br>In the glory of pure manhood<br>He passed o'er the sands of time,<br>Gilding every human virtue<br>With true beauty, rich, sublime.<br><br>Foes might hate, despise, revile Him<br>And His friends unfaithful prove,<br>Satan's arts, nor men's defections<br>Failed His perfect steps to move,<br>Onward to the cross before Him,<br>He did pass in glorious might,<br>There to bear sin's heavy burden<br>And to win the wondrous fight.<br><br>Now with joyful hearts we hail Him<br>Seated on the Father's throne<br>Where adoring hearts surrounding,<br>Praise Him as the Worthy One.<br>Glorious anthems, soaring, swelling,<br>Eulogizing Jesus' Name,<br>Rapturous songs repeat the triumphs,<br>Spread abroad the Victor's fame.<br><br><br>
