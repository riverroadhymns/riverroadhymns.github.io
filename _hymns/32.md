Come, weary one, and find sweet rest:<br>Jesus is passing by!<br>Come where the longing heart is blest,<br>And on His word rely.<br><br>Chorus<br>Passing by! Passing by!<br>Hasten to meet Him on the way,<br>Jesus is passing by today!<br>Passing by! Passing by!<br><br>Come, burdened one, bring all your care:<br>Jesus is passing by!<br>The love that listens to your prayer,<br>Will "no good thing" deny.<br><br>Chorus<br>Passing by! Passing by!<br>Hasten to meet Him on the way,<br>Jesus is passing by today!<br>Passing by! Passing by!<br><br>Come, hungry one, and tell your need;<br>Jesus is passing by!<br>The Bread of Life your soul will feed,<br>And fully satisfy.<br><br>Chorus<br>Passing by! Passing by!<br>Hasten to meet Him on the way,<br>Jesus is passing by today!<br>Passing by! Passing by!<br><br>Come, contrite one, and seek His grace:<br>Jesus is passing by!<br>See in His reconciled face<br>The sunshine of the sky.<br><br>Chorus<br>Passing by! Passing by!<br>Hasten to meet Him on the way,<br>Jesus is passing by today!<br>Passing by! Passing by!<br><br><br>
