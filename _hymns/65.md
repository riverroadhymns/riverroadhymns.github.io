I heard an old, old story,<br>How a Saviour came from glory,<br>How He gave His life on Calvary<br>To save a wretch like me;<br>I heard about His groaning,<br>Of His precious blood's atoning,<br>Then I repented of my sins<br>And won the victory.<br><br>Chorus<br>O victory in Jesus, my Saviour for ever;<br>He sought me and bought me<br>with His redeeming blood;<br>He loved me ere I knew Him,<br>And all my love is due Him,<br>He plunged me to victory<br>Beneath the cleansing flood.<br><br>I heard about His healing,<br>Of His cleansing power revealing,<br>How He made the lame to walk again<br>And caused the blind to see;<br>And then I cried, "Dear Jesus,<br>Come and heal my broken spirit,"<br>And somehow Jesus came and brought<br>To me the victory.<br><br>Chorus<br>O victory in Jesus, my Saviour for ever;<br>He sought me and bought me<br>with His redeeming blood;<br>He loved me ere I knew Him,<br>And all my love is due Him,<br>He plunged me to victory<br>Beneath the cleansing flood.<br><br>I heard about a mansion<br>He has built for me in glory,<br>And I heard about the streets of gold<br>Beyond the crystal sea;<br>About the angels singing,<br>And the old redemption story,<br>And some sweet day I'll sing up there<br>The song of victory.<br><br>Chorus<br>O victory in Jesus, my Saviour for ever;<br>He sought me and bought me<br>with His redeeming blood;<br>He loved me ere I knew Him,<br>And all my love is due Him,<br>He plunged me to victory<br>Beneath the cleansing flood.<br><br><br>
