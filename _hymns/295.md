He is coming, coming for us,<br>Soon we'll see His light afar<br>On the dark horizon rising,<br>As the Bright and Morning Star.<br>Cheering many a waiting watcher<br>As the star whose kindly ray<br>Heralds the approaching morning <br>Just before the break of day<br><br>Chorus<br>O! what joy, as night hangs round us<br>Tis to think of morning's ray;<br>Sweet to know He's coming for us,<br>Just before the break of day.<br><br>He is coming, coming for us;<br>Soon we'll hear His voice on high;<br>Dead and living, rising, changing,<br>In the twinkling of an eye,<br>Shall be caught up all together<br>For the meeting in the air,<br>With a shout, the Lord, descending,<br>Shall Himself await us there.<br><br>Chorus<br>O! what joy, that great foregathering,<br>Trusted meeting in the air;<br>Sweet to know He's coming for us,<br>Calling us to join Him there<br><br>He is coming, O! how solemn<br>When the Judge's voice is heard,<br>And in His own light He shows us<br>Every thought, and act, and word!<br>Deeds of merit, as we thought them<br>He will show us were but sin;<br>Little acts we had forgotten,<br>He will tell us were for Him.<br><br>Chorus<br>O! what joy when He imputeth<br>Righteonsness instead of sin;<br>Sweet to take the linen garments,<br>All a gift and all from Him.<br><br>He is coming as the Bridegroom,<br>Coming to unfold at last<br>The great secrets of His purpose,<br>Mystery of ages past.<br>And the bride, to her is granted<br>In His beauty now to shine,<br>As in rapture she exclaimeth,<br>"I am His, and He is mine."<br><br>Chorus<br>O! what joy that marriage union,<br>Mystery of love divine:<br>Sweet to sing in all its fullness,<br>"I am His and He is mine."<br><br><br>
